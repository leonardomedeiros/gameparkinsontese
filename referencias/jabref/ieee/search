  abstract  = {Pain is a well-recognized nonmotor manifestation of Parkinson disease (PD). This might be related to not only peripheral factors but also abnormal processing of nociceptive input in the central nervous system (CNS). To investigate possible dysfunction of pain pathway or of the processing of pain input in the CNS, we recorded pain-related evoked potentials induced by intra-epidermal electrical stimulation in patients with PD. Pain-related evoked potentials were recorded in 13 patients with PD and 21 healthy controls. The evoked potentials were recorded from the Cz electrode by intra-epidermal electrical stimulation, which is known to selectively stimulate A delta fibers, at the second digit on each of the 4 limbs. The amplitudes between N1 and P1, which are thought to originate from the cingulate cortex and the insula, were significantly lower in patients with PD compared with controls. Patients with PD showed no significant correlation between the severity of clinical parameters, such as Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale or Hoehn and Yahr score, and the amplitudes between N1 and P1. In addition, no differences were found in mean N1 or P1 latency between the two groups. These results may reflect the existence of abnormal central processing of pain inputs in PD, which appears to be independent of the clinical expression of motor dysfunction.},

A sample of 45 subjects (30 normal and 15 PD subjects who underwent STN DBS) was evaluated by gait analysis. PD subjects were assessed under four test conditions: without treatment (mof-sof), only with stimulation (mof-son) or medication (mon-sof), and with combined treatments (mon-son). PC analysis was applied on vGRF, where six PC scores were chosen by the broken stick test. Using a bootstrap approach for the PNN model, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as performance measurement, the first three and fifth PCs were selected as input variables. The PNN presented AUC = 3D 0.995 for classifying controls and PD subjects in the mof-sof condition. When applied to classify the PD subjects under treatment, the PNN indicated that STN DBS alone is more effective than medication, and further vGRF enhancement is obtained with combined therapies.},

Patients were recorded in their home environment during scripted and non-scripted mobility tasks while wearing a full-body kinematic recording system using 11 inertial motion sensors (IMU). Data were analyzed with principal component analysis (PCA) in order to identify kinematic variables which best represent mobility tasks. Results indicate that there was a large degree of variability within subjects for each task, across tasks for individual subjects, and between scripted and non-scripted tasks. This study underscores the potential benefit of whole body multi-sensor kinematic recordings in understanding the variability in task performance across patients during daily activity which may have a significant impact on rehabilitation assessment and intervention.},

This research purposely is to examine the diagnosis of Parkinson disease through the measurement of voice data obtained from UCI repository. The dataset of the voice was initially normalized before conducting the feature selection by means of a number of methods including Correlation-based Feature Selection (CFS), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Wrapper and conducting without feature selection.

Although the exact mechanism remains unclear, oxidative stress plays critical roles in the pathogenesis of PD. DJ-1 is a multifunctional protein, a potent antioxidant and chaperone, linked to autosomal recessive early onset of PD by loss-of-function. Therefore, we investigated the protective effects of transduced Tat-DJ-1 protein against SH-SY5Y cells and PD mouse model. Tat-DJ-1 protein rapidly transduced into the cells and shows protective effect on 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA)-induced neuronal cell death by reduced the reactive oxygen species (ROS). In addition, we found that Tat-DJ-1 protein protects against dopaminergic neuronal cell death in the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1, 2, 3, 6,-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse models. These results suggest that Tat-DJ-1 protein provides a potential strategy for therapeutic delivery in various human diseases including PD.},

  abstract  = {Tremor in Parkinson's disease (PD) is a fundamental feature used in the determination of disease onset and progression. Traditionally, tremor has been evaluated using frequency domain analysis. However, in many cases, this analysis did not show significant differences comparing healthy elders and individuals with PD. Given its complex nature, recently the interest in nonlinear dynamical analysis for better understanding of tremor has grown. In this paper, we examine the effect of PD on the complexity of the tremor time series of PD patients using the approximate entropy method (ApEn). Tremor was also evaluated in the frequency domain. This study involved 11 healthy and 11 PD patients. The peak frequency was similar in both groups, while the amplitude and power in the peak frequency and the total power were significantly higher in PD patients (p$<$;0.0001). A significant reduction (p$<$;0.001) in ApEn was observed in PD. ROC analysis showed that ApEn differentiated physiological tremor from tremor in PD patients with high accuracy. These results are in close agreement with pathophysiological fundamentals, and provide evidence that in PD patients the tremor pattern becomes less complex. Furthermore, our findings also suggest that ApEn has a high clinical potential in assessing PD patients.},

  abstract      = {Background: Immersive augmented reality (IAR) offers flexibility for designing rehabilitation tasks. The role of context in motor performance in persons with Parkinson disease (PD) suggests value in exploring the use of IAR in this population. Objective: Use IAR in a cohort of people with PD and controls to determine: 1) Does motor performance of PD differ between real-world (RW) and IAR tasks?; 2) Is this effect different in PwPD versus controls?; and 3) Does performance change with repeated exposure to the system? Method: Twenty-two participants with PD (15 male, mean age = 67.1 $\pm$ 6.1 years, mean disease duration = 6.2 $\pm$ 3.3 years) and 11 controls (6 male, mean age = 64.1 $\pm$ 5.6 years) completed functionally relevant motor tasks in two IAR scenarios: 1) Watering plants in a living room; and 2) Placing items in baskets at a grocery store. Comparable RW motor tasks were also performed. Visits were once per week for 3 weeks. Results: There was a significant effect of group (F(1, 31) = 4.980, p = 0.033, $\eta$2p = 0.138) and environment (Pillai's F(1, 31) = 98.519, p $<$; 0.001, $\eta$2p = 0.761) in the living room task. For the grocery store scene, there was a multivariate effect of condition (Pillai's Trace F(2, 28) = 19.323, p $<$; 0.05, $\eta$2 = 0.58), of visit (Pillai's Trace F(4, 116) = 3.371, p $<$; 0.05, $\eta$2 = 0.208), and a within subjects multivariate condition x visit interaction (Pillai's Trace F(4, 116) = 4.487, p $<$; 0.002, $\eta$2 = 0.265. Conclusions: An IAR program was developed to simulate two scenes and simple tasks were performed. Differences in performance between the IAR and RW environments may be due to altered delivery of visual information.},

Gait dynamics of normal healthy people are also included in this study as control group. They are also put under study to perform dual task. This data set has been acquired from MIT-BIH data base. All these methods are capable to detect the difference between `Normal walking' and `Dual tasking' for both the groups. The fractal exponents for `Dual task' however produce interesting findings for PD subjects, suggesting that this type of walk is more chaotic and is more disordered than control group with the same task. Amongst the three methods utilized in this work approximate entropy method appears to be more sensitive, for both the groups.},

For constructing the directional brain network from spontaneous activity at rest, we used Directed Transform Function (DTF) approach combining with graph theory. The proposed method applied on each pair of reference time series of the selected regions in the frequency domain. Furthermore, topological parameters like degree of a given node were calculated for graphs in three frequency bandwidths. The result of group comparison between PD and healthy showed that there are few distinctive connections in the upper frequency bandwidth. This result depicted that there are more common influence information in upper band between two groups. Moreover, intergroup comparison analysis of resting state shows that effective interactions in PD are stronger than healthy. Furthermore, some brain regions such as left thalamus has the most information flow in PD which characterized by pivotal regions which were influenced by the other brain regions. We found that DTF analysis in frequency domain combined with graph structure could potentially provide information on directional interactions within regions.},

It is possible to suppose similarities between the parameters of this relation and BG structure. Therefore, this relation can explain the complex behaviours and complex structure of BG. The presented model can simulate globally the BG behaviour. {$\Omega$} parameter of the model has a key role in the model response. It is the main factor which determines that the model is representing a normal person or a PD patient. Our statistical tests show that there is significant difference between the {$\Omega$} of normal and PD patients.

On the other hand, it is less clear whether the BG also contribute to one or the other of these mechanisms, or to both. The current study was principally undertaken to clarify this issue. Parkinson disease (PD), a neurodegenerative disorder primarily affecting the BG, has proven to be an effective model for investigating the contribution of the BG to different brain functions; therefore, we set out to investigate deficits of top--down and bottom--up attention in a selected cohort of PD patients. With this objective in mind, we compared the performance on three computerized tasks of two groups of 12 parkinsonian patients (assessed without any treatment), one otherwise pharmacologically treated and the other also surgically treated, with that of a group of controls. The main behavioral tool for our study was an attentional capture task, which enabled us to tap the competition between top--down and bottom--up mechanisms of visual attention. This task was suitably combined with a choice RT and a simple RT task to isolate any specific deficit of attention from deficits in motor response selection and initiation. In the two groups of patients, we found an equivalent increase of attentional capture but also comparable delays in target selection in the absence of any salient distractor (reflecting impaired top--down mechanisms) and movement initiation compared with controls. In contrast, motor response selection processes appeared to be prolonged only in the operated patients. Our results confirm that the BG are involved in both motor and cognitive domains. Specifically, damage to the BG, as it occurs in PD, leads to a distinct deficit of top--down control of visual attention, and this can account, albeit indirectly,- for the enhancement of attentional capture, reflecting weakened ability of top--down mechanisms to antagonize bottom--up control.},

  abstract  = {To explore the cross-information in multi-modal data, several multivariate data fusion techniques have been proposed. Partial least square (PLS) has great potential for neuroimaging studies. However, when performing group analysis with PLS, the presence of inter-subject variability makes the conventional technique of simply pooling data from different subjects problematic. To circumvent this issue, we introduce the idea of multiblock PLS (mbPLS) which incorporates a hierarchical structure into the ordinary two-block PLS. The mbPLS model groups each subject's detail in individual data blocks on the sub-level, while aggregates the sub-level information to obtain a group {\textquotedblleft}consensus{\textquotedblright} on the super-level. With the hierarchical, two-level design, the mbPLS provides a trade-off between modeling simplicity and preservation of subject specificity. We applied the proposed mbPLS method to concurrent EEG and EMG data collected from normal subjects and patients with Parkinson's disease. The decomposition identifies active brain rhythms and spatial activation pattern involved in the generation of the extracted EEG temporal patterns that show high correlation with EMG signals. The proposed mbPLS framework is a promising technique for performing multi-subject, multi-modal data analysis and it allows for robust group inferences even in the face of large inter-subject variability.},

BG dysfunction caused by Parkinson disease (PD) disrupts the proficiency of action suppression, but how pharmacotherapy for PD impacts impulsive motor control is poorly understood. Dopamine agonists improve motor symptoms of PD but can also provoke impulsive--compulsive behaviors (ICB). We investigated whether dopamine agonist medication has a beneficial or detrimental effect on impulsive action control in 38 PD patients, half of whom had current ICB. Participants performed the Simon conflict task, which measures susceptibility to acting on spontaneous action impulses as well as the proficiency of suppressing these impulses. Compared with an off-agonist state, patients on their agonists were no more susceptible to reacting impulsively but were less proficient at suppressing the interference from the activation of impulsive actions. Importantly, agonist effects depended on baseline performance in the off-agonist state; more proficient suppressors off agonist experienced a reduction in suppression on agonist, whereas less-proficient suppressors off agonist showed improved suppression on agonist. Patients with active ICB were actually less susceptible to making fast, impulsive response errors than patients without ICB, suggesting that behavioral problems in this subset of patients may be less related to impulsivity in motor control. Our findings provide further evidence that dopamine agonist medication impacts specific cognitive control processes and that the direction of its effects depends on individual differences in performance off medication.},

Understanding how dopamine modulates intertemporal choice has important implications for neurobiological models and for understanding the mechanisms underlying maladaptive decision-making. However, the specific role of dopamine in intertemporal decisions is not well understood. Dopamine may play a role in multiple aspects of intertemporal choices---the valuation of choice outcomes and sensitivity to reward delays. To assess the role of dopamine in intertemporal decisions, we tested Parkinson disease patients who suffer from dopamine depletion in the striatum, in either high (on medication, PD\textsubscript{ON}) or low (off medication, PD\textsubscript{OFF}) dopaminergic states. Compared with both PD\textsubscript{OFF} and healthy controls, PD\textsubscript{ON} made more farsighted choices and reduced their valuations less as a function of increasing time to reward. Furthermore, reduced discounting in the high dopaminergic state was robust across multiple measures, providing new evidence for dopamine's role in making decisions about the future.},

Further, for kinematic parameter, overall joint angle of hip, knee and ankle mean values are lower for Parkinson's disease patients as compared to normal group. In addition, for kinetic parameter, all mean values of ground reaction force parameters are higher for normal subjects with walking speed contributed as the major determinant. To evaluate the significant features that could be used as identification between PD and normal subjects, statistical analysis is conducted. Hence, based on the statistical analysis results, it was found that step length, walking speed, knee angle as well as vertical parameter of ground reaction force are the four significant features as indicators for classification of subject with Parkinson's disease based on the accuracy attained with Artificial Neural Network as classifier.},

In these patients, administration of dopamine can modulate emotional facial recognition. We used fMRI to investigate differences in the functional activation in response to emotional and nonemotional gestures between PD patients and age-matched healthy controls (HC). In addition, we used PET to evaluate the striatal dopamine transporter availability (DAT) with [\textsuperscript{11}C]d-threo-methylphenidate in the patient group. Patients showed an average decrease to 26\% in DAT when compared to age-corrected healthy references. Reduction in the DAT of the left putamen correlated not only with motor impairment but also with errors in emotional gesture recognition. In comparison to HC, PD patients showed a specific decrease in activation related to emotional gesture observation in the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (VLPFC) and the right superior temporal sulcus. Moreover, the less DAT present in the left putamen, the lower the activation in the left VLPFC. We conclude that a loss of dopaminergic neurotransmission in the putamen results in a reduction of ventrolateral prefrontal access involved in the recognition of emotional gestures.},

In the next 30 years, this amount is estimated to double due to the increase in the number of ageing people, as age is the leading key risk feature for the start of PD. There are a variety of medications, such as levodopa available to treat PD. With the latest advancement in healthcare technology, current researches permit the monitoring of PD with the application of wearable sensor technology. From previous studies, researchers have realized the application of wearable sensors as a useful tool that had the capability to differentiate various types of PD symptoms using uni-modal sensor or bi-modal sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope). Therefore, early diagnosis of PD through multimodal wearable technology can be considered for this aim. In this paper, the data are collected using on-body triaxial wearable sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and magnetometer) for classifying people with Parkinson (PWP) from healthy controls. The system performance was characterized based on 10-fold cross validation method, applying the proposed time and frequency domain features and classification algorithms. The strength of the proposed method has been evaluated through several performance measures. In summary, these results show that the proposed machine learning techniques had ability in differentiating PWP from healthy controls with highest average accuracy, sensitivity, specificity and ROC of above 88\%.},

A completely non-intrusive, 3D real-time leg pose tracking and gait analysis are proposed by using a depth camera mounted on the rear of the robotic walker. It has been studied that the sensory cues can serve as effective stimuli to the PD patients for gait improvement. In our work, the sensory cues including visual and auditory cues are incorporated into the robotic walker. More specifically, both sensory cues are gait-adaptive, of which the visual cue in particular is projected onto the ground by a projector installed on the walker, in order to stimulate patients walking gait more easily. Since the adjustable cues can improve patients gaits and reduce their uncomfortableness simultaneously, the hereby developed robotic walker serves as a gait rehabilitation mechanism. To demonstrate the performance of the developed walker, several real experiments have been conducted. First, the accuracy of the proposed 3D leg pose tracking is verified by a standard motion capture system. Next, seven participants (4PD patients and 3 healthy elders) are recruited to test the system three days for verifying the effectiveness of participants gait improvement. The experimental results confirm the potential of the walker serving as a rehabilitation device for PD patients. Note to Practitioners-We proposed a completely non-intrusive, relatively inexpensive and real-time gait analyzer integrated with sensory cues guided rehabilitation system on an active robotic walker. Our goal is to provide a smart robotic walker with safety, reliability, and with rehabilitation function for elders whoever suffered from chronic disease or health problem. In this work, a reliable 3D leg pose tracking is proposed. Then, a gait analysis for acquiring spatio-temporal gait parameters such as stride length and gait velocity is proposed based on the tracking to analyze the walking gait of th- patients. On the other hand, improving Parkinson disease patients gaits by using sensory cues which are known to have remarkable effects for Parkinson disease patients is in many research. Therefore, we concentrate on the sensory cues include visual cue and a rhythmic auditory cue cooperating with the robotic walker which aimed to stimulate and provide walkingassistance in their ambulation. For the sensory cues, an adaptive gait mechanism is proposed to improve patients gait based on their personal gait pattern as well as to reduce uncomfortableness of them by doing the rehabilitation. The experimental results confirm the potential of the walker serving as a rehabilitation device for Parkinson disease patients. We hope the new invention of this kind assistive robotic walker will become more popular and may provide more living aid facilities to elders.},

  abstract  = {The medical sonography is an ultrasound-based technique used to visualize internal organs. It is based on detecting the reflections of the waves emitted by a probe. The waves may have various frequencies. Generally, the higher the frequency is, the better and more detailed output images we can get. However, if we want to obtain the brain-stem ultrasound images suitable for the Parkinson disease diagnostics, we can only use the low-frequency probes due to the presence of skull. For this reason, the output images will necessarily be of low quality. In spite of that, these images are essential for the Parkinson disease diagnostics and treatment because, except outer symptoms, they provide the only way how to determine the existence and seriousness of the disease. The low image quality may even lead to the different or inaccurate diagnosis of same image from different medical doctors. Our objective is to create a tool that should help to minimize the physician's subjectivity in the final diagnosis and should provide more exact information about the processed images.},

This work evaluates the fitness with both modeling techniques and their dependence of the linearity regressors and the prediction horizon.

On the other hand, both AR and NLARX had good enough precision that guarantees an accurate simulation.

However, the susceptible accuracy of placement of the DBS electrode inside the brain nucleus determines the therapeutic efficacy of the method. Unlike normal cases, untreated Parkinsonian states in basal ganglia structures produce oscillations at various frequencies, the most prominent of which is a synchronization in the beta frequency band recorded in the subthalamic nucleus (STN). The actual frequency range and the strength of the beta peak vary among patients. We propose that an on-line spectral analysis of the population activity, as evidenced by microelectrode recordings (MERs) could form a neurophysiological biomarker for confirmation of the on-target placement of the electrode within the STN.},

Among the pathological cases, essential and parkinsonian tremor are the most often observed types. However, its objective assessment is very difficult. The methods used for quantification require application of such devices as low G accelerometers and piezoelectric detectors. In the present paper a simple measuring unit consisting of accelerometer transducer with built in A/D conversion and SPI bus is interfaced to a micro controller. The micro -controller acquires the tremor signal in all the three axes. The micro controller then transmits the signal to a PC, where the suitable program acquires the signal, which can be processed using MATLAB program for measuring and quantifying the tremor frequency and amplitude. After establishing the set of processing rules through MATLAB programming a portable and stand alone system can be designed. The proposed system for acquisition and processing of tremor signals can be used as an aid in both medical diagnosing and prognosis of certain neurological disorders.},

An experiment, where the Multi-Cue Unit (MuCU) was tested and evaluated with six Parkinson-patients was set up and carried out. According to the results of the self-assessment, the MuCU is light weight and also very easy to operate. Moreover, four out of all six patients experienced a shorter FOG - episode with the wearable device and preferred the situation-dependent cueing.},

It is characterized by dopaminergic deficiencies in the mid brain that impair motor function. Due to rise in proportion of elderly people the number of patients with Parkinson (PWP) are expected to increase for the coming 25 years. Until now, there are still no solutions towards PD, although medication and surgical intervention can temporarily hold back the progression of the symptom. Therefore, early diagnosis is critical in order in improving PWP disease quality of life and prolong longevity, where many of them will be substantially dependent on clinical intervention. The investigators begin exploring motor disorders and the likelihood of applying various types of sensor to measure the significance of clinical involvements on the quality of movement observed while PWP accomplished different tasks. The focus of this review is to provide a discussion of the capabilities of wearable technology and audio sensors in the assessment of PD symptoms severity.},

These measures were used to determine the symmetry of both upper and lower limbs during walking of 11 early-to-mid-stage PD patients and 15 control subjects. The patients included in the study showed minimal motor abnormalities according to the unified Parkinson's disease rating scale (UPDRS). The symmetry indices were used to classify subjects into two different groups corresponding to PD or control. The proposed method presented high sensitivity and specificity with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.872, 9\% greater than the second best method. The proposed method also showed an excellent intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of 0.949, 55\% greater than the second best method.

Visual classification or quantitative analysis of mean regional uptake has been performed in the past. Our objective is to enable further enhanced clinical utility in the diagnosis as well as tracking of progression in Parkinson's disease via quantification based on pattern recognition. We developed and implemented two such frameworks: first, we utilized shape/texture metrics that did require registration to a common structure/template; e.g. 3D moment-invariants, Haralick texture features, and multiple others. We also used a surface registration algorithm, which falls under the broad class of Large Deformation Diffeomorphic Metric Mapping (LDDMM). In this latter framework, we obtain a common coordinate system for the entire population based on MR images, and compare SPECT intensities across subjects in this common coordinate system. This method has the advantage of estimating population-based templates for each structure individually rather than using a predetermined collective atlas for all regions, as is customary. In this common coordinate system, we then used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on intensities to obtain sub-regions (set of voxels inside the structure of interest) with highest variance in SPECT intensities across subjects. We show that the healthy and diseased populations can be subsequently distinguished. Via these methods, we also aimed to assess correlations with different clinical measures (e.g. UPDRS score, disease duration). In addition to enabling enhanced diagnostic task performance, these methods have considerable potential as biomarkers of PD progression.},

To record movements of the upper extremities, a sensing units which included miniature gyroscopes, has been fixed to each of the forearms. An algorithm to detect and quantify tremor and another algorithm to quantify bradykinesia have been proposed and validated. Two clinical studies have been performed. In the first study, 10 PD patients and 10 control subjects participated in a 45-min protocol of 17 typical daily activities. The algorithm for tremor detection showed an overall sensitivity of 99.5\% and a specificity of 94.2\% in comparison to a video reference. The estimated tremor amplitude showed a high correlation to the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) tremor subscore (e.g., r=0.87, p$<$0.001 for the roll axis). There was a high and significant correlation between the estimated bradykinesia related parameters estimated for the whole period of measurement and respective UPDRS subscore (e.g., r=-0.83, p$<$0.001 for the roll axis). In the second study, movements of upper extremities of 11 PD patients were recorded for periods of 3-5 hr. The patients were moving freely during the measurements. The effects of selection of window size used to calculate tremor and bradykinesia related parameters on the correlation between UPDRS and these parameters were studied. By selecting a window similar to the period of the first study, similar correlations were obtained. Moreover, one of the bradykinesia related parameters showed significant correlation (r=-0.74, p$<$0.01) to UPDRS with window sizes as short as 5 min. Our study provides evidence that objective, accurate and simultaneous assessment of tremor and bradykinesia can be achieved in free moving PD patients during their daily activities},

Our primary goal is to develop a monitoring system capable of being used outside of controlled laboratory settings. Such a system would enable us to track medication cycles at home and provide valuable clinical feedback. Most of the relevant prior works involve supervised learning frameworks (e.g., Support Vector Machines). However, in-home monitoring provides only coarse ground truth information about symptom occurrences, making it very hard to adapt and train supervised learning classifiers for symptom detection. We address this challenge by formulating symptom detection under incomplete ground truth information as a multiple instance learning (MIL) problem. MIL is a weakly supervised learning framework that does not require exact instances of symptom occurrences for training; rather, it learns from approximate time intervals within which a symptom might or might not have occurred on a given day. Once trained, the MIL detector was able to spot symptom-prone time windows on other days and approximately localize the symptom instances. We monitored two Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, each for four days with a set of five triaxial accelerometers and utilized a MIL algorithm based on axis parallel rectangle (APR) fitting in the feature space. We were able to detect subject specific symptoms (e.g. dyskinesia) that conformed with a daily log maintained by the patients.},

Electrophysiological data has been collected in PD patients and primates to better understand the impact of DBS on STN and the entire Basal Ganglia (BG) motor circuit. We use single unit recordings from Globus Pallidus, both pars interna and externa segments (GPi and GPe) in the BG, in a normal primate before and after DBS to reconstruct Local Field Potentials (LFPs) in the region. We then use system identification techniques to understand how GPe LFP activity and the DBS signal applied to STN influence GPi LFP activity. Our models suggest that when no stimulation is applied, the GPe LFPs have an inhibitory effect on GPi LFPs with a 2-3 ms delay, as is the case for single unit neuronal activity. On the other hand, when DBS is ON the models suggest that stimulation has a dominant effect on GPi LFPs which mask the inhibitory effects of GPe.},

Therefore, accurate prediction of PD need to be done in order to assist medical or bio-informatics practitioners for initial diagnose of PD based on variety of test results. This paper described the analysis conducted based on two training algorithms namely Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) and Scaled Conjugate Gradient (SCG) of Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) Neural Network in diagnosing PD with Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) as a feature selection. The dataset information of this project has been taken from the Parkinson Disease Data Set.

Here, for the first time, we demonstrate rapid, remote replication of UPDRS assessment with clinically useful accuracy (about 7.5 UPDRS points difference from the clinicians' estimates), using only simple, self-administered, and noninvasive speech tests. We characterize speech with signal processing algorithms, extracting clinically useful features of average PD progression. Subsequently, we select the most parsimonious model with a robust feature selection algorithm, and statistically map the selected subset of features to UPDRS using linear and nonlinear regression techniques that include classical least squares and nonparametric classification and regression trees. We verify our findings on the largest database of PD speech in existence (~6000 recordings from 42 PD patients, recruited to a six-month, multicenter trial). These findings support the feasibility of frequent, remote, and accurate UPDRS tracking. This technology could play a key part in telemonitoring frameworks that enable large-scale clinical trials into novel PD treatments.},

Experimental results showed that using either auto-correlation or cross-correlation features for classification provided over 91\% correct classification. Using both features together provided better performance (96.0\%) than using either feature alone. In addition, the performance of LS-SVM is better than that of self-organizing map (SOM) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) in this case.},

  abstract = {Effective clinical trials for neuroprotective interventions for Parkinson's disease (PD) require a way to quantify an individual's motor symptoms and analyze the change in these symptoms over time. Clinical scales provide a global picture of function but cannot precisely measure specific aspects of motor control. We have used commercially available sensors to create a protocol called Advanced Sensing for Assessment of Parkinson's disease (ASAP) to obtain a quantitative and reliable measure of motor impairment in early to moderate PD. The ASAP protocol measures grip force as an individual tracks a sinusoidal or pseudorandom target force under three conditions of increasing cognitive load. Thirty individuals with PD have completed the ASAP protocol. The ASAP data for 26 of these individuals were summarized in terms of 36 variables, and modified regression techniques were used to predict an individual's score on the Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale based on ASAP data. We observed a mean prediction error of approximately 3.5 UPDRS points, and the predicted score accounted for approximately 76\% of the variability of the UPDRS. These results demonstrate that the ASAP protocol can measure differences for individuals who are clinically different. This indicates that the ASAP protocol may be able to measure changes with time in the motor signs of an individual with PD.},

In this paper, a signal-dependent method is presented for identification of the STN and other brain zones in Parkinsonian patients. The proposed method, refereed as optimal wavelet feature extraction method (OWFE), is constructed by lifting schemes (LS), which are a flexible and fast implementation of the wavelet transform (WT). The operators in the LS are optimized by means of Genetic Algorithms and Lagrange multipliers considering information contained in MER signals. Then a basic Bayesian classifier (LDC) is used to identify STN and other types of basal ganglia nuclei. The proposed method introduced several advantages from similar works reported in literature. First, the method is signal-dependent and non a priori information is required to decompose the MER signal. Second, the classification accuracy is mostly depended on the feature selection stage because it is not enhanced by elaborated classifiers such as support vector machines or hidden Markov models. Finally, the generalization property of the OWFE has been validated with two databases and different types of classifiers such as k-NN classifier and quadratic Bayesian classifier (QDC). Results have shown that proposed method is able to identify the STN with average accuracy superior than 97\%.},

The progression of the disease can be measured by the UPDRS (Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale) scale which is used to evaluate behavioral and motor symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Hitherto the evaluation of the advancement of the disease in the UPDRS scale is made by a specialist through medical observation. The authors suggest a partial automation of this process, i.e. using a multimodal interface called Virtual-Touchpad (VTP) may support the medical diagnosis. The VTP is based on processing the image of hand acquired by a camera. Therefore, a patient is not constrained by any equipment. Two types of UPDRS tests that can be supported by VTP are presented in the paper. In the Finger Taps test the patient taps thumb with the index finger in rapid succession. The Rapid Alternating Movement of Hands test consists in pronation-supination movements of hands. VTP captures the image of the patient's hand while performing the test and, based on this image, it assigns hand gesture to the given class. The hand movement velocity is measured and used in the diagnostic process.},

Later, ten Parkinson's disease (PD) patients with subthalamic nucleus deep brain stimulation (STN-DBS) implantation participated in gait measurements using our device. They walked one to three times on a 20-m walkway. Patients did the test twice: once STN-DBS was ON and once 180 min after turning it OFF. A group of ten age-matched normal subjects were also measured as controls. For each gait cycle, spatio-temporal parameters such as stride length (SL), stride velocity (SV), stance (ST), double support (DS), and gait cycle time (GC) were calculated. We found that PD patients had significantly different gait parameters comparing to controls. They had 52\% less SV, 60\% less SL, and 40\% longer GC. Also they had significantly longer ST and DS (11\% and 59\% more, respectively) than controls. STN-DBS significantly improved gait parameters. During the stim ON period, PD patients had 31\% faster SV, 26\% longer SL, 6\% shorter ST, and 26\% shorter DS. GC, however, was not significantly different. Some of the gait parameters had high correlation with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) subscores including SL with a significant correlation (r=-0.90) with UPDRS gait subscore. We concluded that our method provides a simple yet effective way of ambulatory gait analysis in PD patients with results confirming those obtained from much more complex and expensive methods used in gait labs.},

Disease severity, main symptoms and biological factors play a role in correctly setting up the device. Currently there are no objective methods to assess the efficacy of DBS, hence the adjustment is based solely on clinical assessment. In optimal case an objectively measurable feature would point the right settings of DBS. Surface electromyographic and kinematic measurements have been used in Parkinson's disease research. As Parkinson's disease symptoms are known to change the EMG signal properties, these methods could be helpful aid in the clinical adjustment of DBS. In this study, 13 patients with advanced Parkinson's disease who received DBS treatment were measured. The patients were measured with seven different settings of the DBS in clinical range including changes in stimulation amplitude, frequency and pulse width. The EMG analysis was based on parameters that characterize EMG signal morphology. Correlation dimension and recurrence rate made the most significant difference in relation to optimal settings. In conclusion, EMG analysis is able to detect differences between the DBS setups, and can help in finding the correct parameters.},

Quantitative methods are needed to fully characterize the electric field in the deep brain region that surrounds the electrodes in order to help with adjustments and maximize the efficacy of the device. Herein we report a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based head model proposed for analysis of fields generated by deep brain stimulation (DBS). The model was derived from multimodal image data at 0.5mm isotropic spatial resolution and distinguishes 142 anatomical structures, including the basal ganglia and 38 nuclei of the thalamus. Six bipolar electrode configurations (1-2, 1-3, 1-4, 2-3, 2-4, 3-4) were modeled in order to assess the effects of the inter-electrode distance of the electric field. Increasing the distance between the electrodes results in an attenuated stimulation, with up to 25\% reduction in electric field amplitude delivered (2-3 vs. 1-4). The map of the deep brain structures provided a highly precise anatomical detail which is useful for the quantitative assessment of current spread around the electrode and a better evaluation of the stimulation setting for the treatment optimization.},

We show that the model is able to predict both the exact timing and the rhythm of the recorded spikes with high accuracy in 5 out of 7 intranuclear single neuron recordings. For the rest of the models, one model shows a lower accuracy in predicting the rhythm and the second one shows a lower accuracy in predicting the timing of the spikes.

A computational model is presented to investigate the hypothesis that interconnectivity and transmission delays within the subthalamic nucleus (STN) neurons may induce a gradual decay and recovery of pathological oscillations at DBS onset and offset under simulated parkinsonian conditions. Interconnectivity strength between the STN neurons and the number of STN neurons directly stimulated by DBS are both varied to examine the gradual decay and recovery of oscillatory STN activity. Weaker interconnectivity and lower numbers of STN neurons directly receiving DBS input were found to result in longer decay and recovery times at the onset and offset of DBS, respectively.},

From the recorded data a set of features was derived to represent the movement characteristics that evaluators assess for scoring bradykinesia according to the MDS-UPDRS. These features and the averaged scores of the evaluators were used to create a model for the score on each item using backward linear regression. The estimated generalization errors indicate that the continuous objective scale can obtain an automatic score with an average error of 0.50 compared to the evaluators' averaged scores.},

  abstract  = {Quantitative electromyographic (EMG) signal analysis in the frequency domain using classical power spectrum analysis techniques has been well documented over the past decade. Yet due to the nature of EMG, frequency analysis cannot be used to approximate a signal whose properties change over time. To address this problem a time varying feature representation has to be analyzed to extract useful information from the signal. In this paper, wavelet analysis technique has been used to extract features from EMG, and linear discriminant analysis have been used to classify the signal into two classes, normal or abnormal, which reflects the loss of rapid eye movement sleep atonia commonly seen in Parkinson disease (PD). An overall classification accuracy of 94.3\% was achieved.},

Since the characteristic gait patterns of PD patients may not be fully identified by brief examination in a clinic, long-term, and unobtrusive monitoring of their activities is essential, especially in a nonclinical setting. This paper describes a single accelerometer-based gait analysis system for the assessment of ambulatory gait properties. Acceleration data were recorded continuously for up to 24 h from normal and PD subjects, from which gait peaks were picked out and the relationship between gait cycle and vertical gait acceleration was evaluated. By fitting a model equation to the relationships, a quantitative index was obtained for characterizing the subjects' walking behavior. The averaged index for PD patients with gait disorder was statistically smaller than the value for normal subjects. The proposed method could be used to evaluate daily gait characteristics and thus contribute to a more refined diagnosis and treatment of the disease.},

EVestG data of 20 individuals with PD and 28 healthy controls were adopted from a previous study. The field potentials and their firing pattern in response to whole body tilt stimuli from both left and right ears were extracted. We investigated several statistical and fractal features of the field potentials and also their firing patterns. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to select the features showing the most significant differences between individuals with PD and the age-matched controls. Linear Discriminant analysis classification was applied to every selected feature using a leave-one-out routine. The result of each feature's classifier was used in a heuristic weighted average voting system to diagnose PD patients. The weights of the voting system were the (posterior) probabilities calculated by the designed classifier to indicate a subject related to a specific class. The results show more than 97\% accuracy for PD diagnosis. Given that the patients were at different stage of disease, the high accuracy of the results encourages the use of vestibular response for PD diagnosis as a plausible quick and non-invasive screening tool.},

Traditionally, the most popular method to assess corticomuscular coupling has been the pairwise magnitude-squared coherence (MSC) between EEG and concomitant EMG recordings. In this paper, we propose assessing corticomuscular coupling by combining partial least squares (PLS) and independent component analysis (ICA), which addresses many of the limitations of MSC, such as difficulty in robustly assessing group inference and relying on the biologically implausible assumption of pairwise interaction between brain and muscle recordings. In the proposed framework, response relevance and statistical independence are jointly incorporated into a multiobjective optimization function to meaningfully combine the goals of PLS and ICA under the same mathematical umbrella. Simulations, performed under realistic assumptions, illustrated the utility of such an approach. The method was extended to address intersubject variability to robustly discover common corticomuscular coupling patterns across subjects. We then applied the proposed framework to concurrent EEG and EMG data collected in a Parkinson's disease (PD) study. The results from applying the proposed technique revealed temporal components in the EEG and EMG that were significantly correlated with one another. In addition to the expected motor areas, the corresponding spatial activation patterns demonstrated enhanced occipital connectivity in PD subjects, consistent with previous studies suggesting that PD subjects rely excessively on visual information to counteract the deficiency in being able to generate internal commands from their affected basal ganglia.},

Dopaminergic treatment in PD can induce abnormal involuntary movements, including choreatic dyskinesia (brief, rapid, irregular movements). Adjustments in medication to reduce LID often sacrifice control of motor symptoms, and balancing this tradeoff poses a significant challenge for management of advanced PD. Fifteen PD subjects with known LID were recruited and instructed to perform two stationary motor tasks while wearing a compact wireless motion sensor unit positioned on each hand over the course of a levodopa dose cycle. Videos of subjects performing the motor tasks were later scored by expert clinicians to assess global dyskinesia using the modified Abnormal Involuntary Rating Scale (m-AIMS). Kinematic features were extracted from motion data in different frequency bands (1-3Hz and 3-8Hz) to quantify LID severity and to distinguish between LID and PD tremor. Receiver operator characteristic analysis was used to determine thresholds for individual features to detect the presence of LID. A sensitivity of 0.73 and specificity of 1.00 were achieved. A neural network was also trained to output dyskinesia severity on a 0 to 4 scale, similar to the m-AIMS. The model generalized well to new data (coefficient of determination= 0.85 and mean squared error= 0.3). This study demonstrated that hand-worn motion sensors can be used to assess global dyskinesia severity independent of PD tremor over the levodopa dose cycle.},

The best adjustment obtained was when the proportional and derivative factors where the same as for healthy young adults and noise level gain and force feedback gain varied independently.

  abstract  = {A ldquoMulti-parametric system for the continuous assessment and monitoring of motor status in Parkinson's diseaserdquo (PERFORM), is an FP7 project from the European Commission that aims at providing an innovative and reliable tool, able to evaluate, monitor and manage patients suffering from motor neurodegenerative diseases. The current work is related to a module of the project that is in charge of assessing PD patients during locomotion. These initial analyses of gait are based on analyses of sample entropy in the acceleration signals. Four PD patients are compared to four healthy using a set of five wireless sensors located in the limbs and in the trunk. A metric to assess the level of symmetry during locomotion, an important clinical feature, is proposed. Results show considerable differences between the patients and the subjects, both for sample entropy (in 3 of the 5 sensors) and in the gait asymmetry index (left vs. right limbs). Future work is proposed including age-matched subjects and a larger sample.},
