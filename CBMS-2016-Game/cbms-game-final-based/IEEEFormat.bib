	toring. This minimizes the need for caregivers and helps the chronically
	ill and elderly to survive an independent life, besides provides
	quality care for the babies and little children whose both parents
	have to work. Dados: One of the major challenges of the world for
	the last decades has been the continuous elderly population increase
	in the developed countries. Pop- ulation Reference Bureau [2] forecasts
	that in the next 20 years, the 65-and-over population in the developed
	countries will be nearly 20% of the overall population. Motivação:
	One promising application in that area is the integration of sensing
	and consumer electronics technologies which would allow people to
	be constantly monitored. In-home pervasive networks may assist residents
	and their caregivers by providing continuous medical monitoring,
	memory enhancement, control of home appliances, medical data access,
	and emergency communication. Researchers in computer, networking,
	and medical fields are working together in order to make the broad
	vision of smart healthcare possible. The importance of integrating
	large-scale wireless telecommunication technologies such as 3G, Wi-Fi
	Mesh, and WiMAX, with telemedicine has already been addressed by
	some researchers. Outras Tecnologias: Further improvements will be
	achieved by the coexistence of small-scale personal area technologies
	like radio frequency identification (RFID), Bluetooth, ZigBee, and
	wireless sensor networks, together with large-scale wireless networks
	to provide context-aware applications Monitoramento Contínuo Permitirá:
	Given the importance of the subject, there are already several applications
	and prototypes on the subject. For example, some of them are devoted
	to continuous monitoring for cognitive disorders like Alzheimer’s,
	Parkinson’s or similar cognitive diseases. Some focus on fall detection,
	posture detection and location tracking and others make use of biological
	and environmental sensors to identify patients’ health status. Benefícios
	e Considerações de Design para Sistemas de Monitoramento para Healthcare
	In healthcare applications, a real-time system is actually a soft
	real-time system, in which some latency is allowed [13]. Identifying
	emergency situations like heart attacks or sudden falls in a few
	seconds or even minutes will suffice for saving lives considering
	that, without them these conditions will not be identified at all.
	Together with the mature and also inexpensive RFID technology, the
	costs for pervasive healthcare systems are within the affordable
	range for many people. In Caregiver’s Assistant [14], inexpensive
	RFID tags are placedon household object and the systems precision
	can be in- creased at very low costs, by tagging more objects with
	these RFID tags. Most of the existing solutions include one or more
	types of sensors carried by the patient, forming a Body Area Network
	(BAN), and one or more types of sensors deployed in the environment
	forming a Personal Area Network (PAN). The emergency situations produce
	alerts by the application and these alerts and other health status
	information can be reached via mo- bile devices like laptop computers,
	Personal Digital Assistants (PDAs) and smart phones. The overview
	of a simple wireless sensor network application scenario is depicted
	in Fig. 1. Possíveis Usuários: Children: this group consists of young
	people who are not capable of taking care of themselves like babies,
	Elderly and chronically ill: this group includes the chronically
	ill people who have cognitive difficulties or other medical disorders
	related with heart, respiration, etc. Caregivers: this group is comprised
	of the parents and the baby-sitters of the children group and also
	the caregivers and other care network of the elderly and the chronically
	ill. Healthcare professionals: these are the professional caregivers
	like physicians and other medical staff who are responsible from
	the constant health status monitoring of the elderly and the chronically
	ill people and are capable of giving the immediate response in case
	of an emergency situation. COLOCAR A TABELA 1. Considerações de Design
	Body Area Network Subsystem The Body Area Network Subsystem is the
	ad hoc sensor network and tags that the children and the elderly
	carry on their body. The RFID tags, ElectroCardioGram (ECG) sensors,
	and accelerometers worn by the patient, are example components of
	the body area network. LER ----- Zhou et al. propose a three layer
	network structure for a pervasive medical supervision system based
	on wireless sensor networks [86]. The first layer is the medical
	sensor layer providing information such as the oximetry, the heart
	rate/pulse and the blood pressure. The medical sensors form a star
	schema network with a gateway node elected by either a self-organizing
	protocol or manual configura- tion. The second layer provides reliable
	transmission. If the patient is at home, the physiological data is
	transferred to one of the nearest wireless nodes that are emplaced
	in the house. These nodes not only relay the data to the PC with
	an Internet connection in a multi-hop manner but also provide contextual
	data such as temperature, and the patient’s video/picture in emergency
	situations. When the patient is outside, the relay mission is accomplished
	by a mobile phone or a PDA device. The third layer of the system
	is responsible for the aggregation of physiological data in a remote
	medical center for analysis and providing feed-back data back to
	the patient through a mobile phone, a PDA or web services. Another
	example is the Baby Glove [87] which consists of two integrated sensor
	plates placed on infant’s upper torso, which contain a temperature
	sensor and electrodes that monitor the infant’s pulse rate and hydration.
	The device is comprised of two motes. One is connected to the infant’s
	clothing and the other to a base station computer. The first mote
	collects the vital sign information coming from the sensors and transmits
	them wirelessly to the second mote which is connected to the base
	station computer for processing. If the vital signs are over the
	limits, the caregivers are alerted. LISTENse is a prototype that
	enables the hearing impaired to perceive the critical sound information
	like doorbell or smoke alarm. It is comprised of at least two wireless
	sensor network motes. There are also some studies for identification
	of complications of some diseases such as epilepsy seizure. AWARENESS
	[90] is an example context-aware health application that is designed
	to detect and react to epilepsy seizures. In a neurological body
	area network prototype, the ECG data captures an epilepsy seizure;
	however, without the context information the change in the heart
	rate cannot be reliably attributed to an epilepsy seizure since it
	may be due to motion. Challenges and open research problems of the

	many applications, primarily in calculating metabolic equivalent
	rates and extracting human context awareness. Many classifiers that
	train on an activity at a subset of intensity levels fail to recognize
	the same activity at other intensity levels. This demonstrates weakness
	in the underlying classification method. Training a classifier for
	an activity at every intensity level is also not practical. In this
	paper, we tackle a novel intensity-independent activity recognition
	problem where the class labels exhibit large variability, the data
	are of high dimensionality, and clustering algorithms are necessary.
	We propose a new robust stochastic approximation framework for enhanced
	classification of such data. Experiments are reported using two clustering
	techniques, K-Means and Gaussian Mixture Models. The stochastic approximation
	algorithm consistently outperforms other well-known classification
	schemes which validate the use of our proposed clustered data representation.
	We verify the motivation of our framework in two applications that
	benefit from intensity-independent activity recognition. The first
	application shows how our framework can be used to enhance energy
	expenditure calculations. The second application is a novel exergaming
	environment aimed at using games to reward physical activity performed
	throughout the day, to encourage a healthy lifestyle.},

  abstract = {Objectives: The aging of the population creates pressure on the healthcare
	systems in various ways. A massive increase of chronic disease conditions
	and age-related illness are predicted as the dominant forces driving
	the future health care. The objective of this paper is to present
	future research demands in pervasive healthcare with the goal to
	meet the healthcare challenges by paving the way for a pervasive,
	user-centered and preventive healthcare model. Methods: This paper
	presents recent methodological approaches and proposes future research
	topics in three areas: i) pervasive, continuous and reliable long-term
	monitoring systems; ii) prevention through pervasive technology as
	a key element to maintain lifelong wellness; and iii) design and
	evaluation methods for ubiquitous, patient-centric technologies.
	Results: Pervasive technology has been identified as a strong asset
	for achieving the vision of user-centered preventive healthcare.
	In order to make this vision a reality, new strategies for design,
	development and evaluation of technology have to find a common denominator
	and consequently interoperate. Moreover, the potential of pervasive
	healthcare technologies offers new opportunities beyond traditional
	disease treatment and may play a major role in prevention, e.g. motivate
	healthy behavior and disease prevention throughout all stages of
	life. In this sense, open challenges in future research have to be
	addressed such as the variability of health indicators between individuals
	and the manner in which relevant health indicators are provided to
	the users in order to maximize their motivation to mitigate or prevent
	unhealthy behaviors. Additionally, collecting evidence that pervasive
	technology improves health is seen as one of the toughest challenges.
	Promising approaches are recently introduced, such as "clinical proof-of-concept"
	and balanced observational studies. Conclusions: The paper concludes
	that pervasive healthcare will enable a paradigm shift from the established
	centralized healthcare model to a pervasive, user-centered and preventive
	overall lifestyle health management. In order to provide these new
	opportunities everywhere, anytime and to anyone, future research
	in the fields of pervasive sensing, pervasive prevention and evaluation
	of pervasive technology is inevitably needed.},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND} About 50\% of the patients with advanced Parkinson's
	disease ({PD)} suffer from freezing of gait ({FOG)}, which is a sudden
	and transient inability to walk. It often causes falls, interferes
	with daily activities and significantly impairs quality of life.
	Because gait deficits in {PD} patients are often resistant to pharmacologic
	treatment, effective non-pharmacologic treatments are of special
	interest. Objectives: The goal of our study is to evaluate the concept
	of a wearable device that can obtain real-time gait data, processes
	them and provides assistance based on pre-determined specifications.
	{METHODS} We developed a real-time wearable {FOG} detection system
	that automatically provides a cueing sound when {FOG} is detected
	and which stays until the subject resumes walking. We evaluated our
	wearable assistive technology in a study with 10 {PD} patients. Over
	eight hours of data was recorded and a questionnaire was filled out
	by each patient. {RESULTS} Two hundred and thirty-seven {FOG} events
	have been identified by professional physiotherapists in a post-hoc
	video analysis. The device detected the {FOG} events online with
	a sensitivity of 73.1\% and a specificity of 81.6\% on a 0.5 sec
	frame-based evaluation. {CONCLUSIONS} With this study we show that
	online assistive feedback for {PD} patients is possible. We present
	and discuss the patients' and physiotherapists' perspectives on wearability
	and performance of the wearable assistant as well as their gait performance
	when using the assistant and point out the next research steps. Our
	results demonstrate the benefit of such a context-aware system and
	motivate further studies.},

	tensões entre os workshops, para ele os profissionais da saúde e
	os idosos. Para eles os profissionais acham q os idosos querem evitar
	doenças a todo custo. Enquanto que os idosos querem gozar da saúde
	que possuem entre seus 65 e 70 anos. Artigo muito bom, demonstrando

	com o design centrado no usuário. O foco da pesquisa é como desenvolver
	tecnologia de assistencia médica adequado a rotina diária dos usuários,
	buscando propor uma ferramenta para idosos independente e adequada
	a rotina através da ubiquidade. 1o Workshop: foi realizado com médicos

	crônicos e idosos, ainda sofrem rejeição a respeito do design da

	monitorar a alimentação e as horas de sono de um idoso. Os sistemas

	que são vistos como "incapazes" de enteder os dados produzidos. Pelo

	the immersive, attention-maintaining properties of stories and fantasy,

	health disorders are being addressed: obesity, speech problems, rehabilitation,
	neurological disabilities, psychomotor coordination, etc.: Serious
	Games for health prevention and education. Depending on the people
	to whom the games are oriented, they work on aspects such as: diet,

  abstract = {The current work describes a methodology to automatically detect the
	severity of bradykinesia in motor disease patients using wireless,
	wearable accelerometers. This methodology was tested with cross validation
	through a sample of 20 Parkinson's disease patients. The assessment
	of methodology was carried out through some daily living activities
	which were detected using an activity recognition algorithm. The
	Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) severity classification
	of the algorithm coincides between 70 and 86% from that of a trained
	neurologist depending on the classifier used. These severities were
	calculated for 5 second segments of the signal with 50% of overlap.
	A bradykinesia profiler is also presented in this work. This profiler
	removes the overlap of the segments and calculates the confidence
	of the resulting events. It also calculates average severity, duration
	and symmetry values for those events. The profiler has been tested
	with a bogus dataset. Future work includes better training for the
	severity classifier with a larger sample and testing the profiler
	with real, longterm patient data in a projected pilot phase in three
	European hospitals.},

	leads to large integration errors that grow with time. To compensate
	for that drift, complementary data from accelerometers are normally
	fused into the tracking systems using the Kalman or extended Kalman
	filter (EKF). In this study, we combine kinematic models designed
	for control of robotic arms with the unscented Kalman filter (UKF)
	to continuously estimate the angles of human shoulder and elbow using
	two wearable sensors. This methodology can easily be generalized
	to track other human joints. We validate the method with an optical

  title = {Effect of gait speed on gait rhythmicity in Parkinson's disease:
	variability of stride time and swing time respond differently.},
  journal = {J Neuroengineering Rehabil},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {2},
  month = jul,
  abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The ability to maintain a steady gait rhythm is impaired
	in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). This aspect of locomotor
	dyscontrol, which likely reflects impaired automaticity in PD, can
	be quantified by measuring the stride-to-stride variability of gait
	timing. Previous work has shown an increase in both the variability
	of the stride time and swing time in PD, but the origins of these
	changes are not fully understood. Patients with PD also generally
	walk with a reduced gait speed, a potential confounder of the observed
	changes in variability. The purpose of the present study was to examine
	the relationship between walking speed and gait variability. METHODS:
	Stride time variability and swing time variability were measured
	in 36 patients with PD (Hoehn and Yahr stage 2-2.5) and 30 healthy
	controls who walked on a treadmill at four different speeds: 1) Comfortable
	walking speed (CWS), 2) 80\% of CWS 3) 90\% of CWS, and 4) 110\%
	of CWS. In addition, we studied the effects of walking slowly on
	level ground, both with and without a walker. RESULTS: Consistent
	with previous findings, increased variability of stride time and
	swing time was observed in the patients with PD in CWS, compared
	to controls. In both groups, there was a small but significant association
	between treadmill gait speed and stride time variability such that
	higher speeds were associated with lower (better) values of stride
	time variability (p = 0.0002). In contrast, swing time variability
	did not change in response to changes in gait speed. Similar results
	were observed with walking on level ground. CONCLUSION: The present
	results demonstrate that swing time variability is independent of

	it may be used as a speed-independent marker of rhythmicity and gait
	steadiness. Since walking speed did not affect stride time variability
	and swing time variability in the same way, it appears that these
	two aspects of gait rhythmicity are not entirely controlled by the
	same mechanisms. The present findings also suggest that the increased
	gait variability in PD is disease-related, and not simply a consequence

	effectiveness of a video-game intervention for improving adherence
	and other behavioral outcomes for adolescents and young adults with
	malignancies including acute leukemia, lymphoma, and soft-tissue
	sarcoma. {METHODS.} A randomized trial with baseline and 1- and 3-month
	assessments was conducted from 2004 to 2005 at 34 medical centers
	in the United States, Canada, and Australia. A total of 375 male
	and female patients who were 13 to 29 years old, had an initial or
	relapse diagnosis of a malignancy, and currently undergoing treatment
	and expected to continue treatment for at least 4 months from baseline
	assessment were randomly assigned to the intervention or control
	group. The intervention was a video game that addressed issues of
	cancer treatment and care for teenagers and young adults. Outcome
	measures included adherence, self-efficacy, knowledge, control, stress,
	and quality of life. For patients who were prescribed prophylactic
	antibiotics, adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was tracked
	by electronic pill-monitoring devices (n = 200). Adherence to 6-mercaptopurine
	was assessed through serum metabolite assays (n = 54). {RESULTS.}
	Adherence to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and 6-mercaptopurine was
	greater in the intervention group. Self-efficacy and knowledge also
	increased in the intervention group compared with the control group.
	The intervention did not affect self-report measures of adherence,
	stress, control, or quality of life. {CONCLUSIONS.} The video-game
	intervention significantly improved treatment adherence and indicators
	of cancer-related self-efficacy and knowledge in adolescents and
	young adults who were undergoing cancer therapy. The findings support
	current efforts to develop effective video-game interventions for
	education and training in health care.},

  abstract = {{BACKGROUND} Ten-year follow-up results from the Parkinson's Disease
	Research Group of the United Kingdom trial demonstrated that there
	were no long-term advantages to initiating treatment with bromocriptine
	compared with l-dopa in early Parkinson disease ({PD).} Increased
	mortality in patients on selegiline combined with l-dopa led to premature
	termination of this arm after 6 years. {METHODS} Between 1985 and
	1990, 782 patients were recruited into an open pragmatic multicenter
	trial and were randomized to l-dopa/decarboxylase inhibitor ({DDCI)},
	l-{dopa/DDCI} plus selegiline, or bromocriptine. The main endpoints
	were mortality, disability, and motor complications. For final follow-up,
	health-related quality of life and mental function were also assessed.
	{RESULTS} Median duration of follow-up at final assessment was 14
	years in the 166 (21\%) surviving participants who could be contacted.
	After adjustment for baseline characteristics, disability scores
	were better in the l-dopa than in the bromocriptine arm (Webster:
	16.6 vs 19.8; p = 0.03; Northwestern University Disability: 34.3
	vs 30.0, p = 0.05). Physical functioning (difference 20.8; 95\% {CI}

	survey were also superior on l-dopa. Differences in mortality rates
	and prevalence of dyskinesias, motor fluctuations, and dementia were
	not significantly different. {CONCLUSION} Initial treatment with
	the dopamine agonist bromocriptine did not reduce mortality or motor
	disability and the initially reduced frequency in motor complications
	was not sustained. We found no evidence of a long-term benefit or
	clinically relevant disease-modifying effect with initial dopamine

  abstract = {Almost all patients with Parkinson's disease will eventually require
	levodopa during the course of their disease. The effectiveness of
	levodopa is evident, but earlier use and higher doses are causative
	of the emergence of motor fluctuations. About one half of patients
	develop motor fluctuations 4-6 years after starting levodopa therapy
	for parkinsonian symptoms. Peripheral and central pharmacokinetic
	mechanisms are related to motor fluctuations. It was reported that
	time to peak concentration (Tmax) and elimination half-life (T(1/2))
	of levodopa decreased especially in patients with wearing-off (peripheral
	pharmacokinetics). On the other hand, there are several reports demonstrating
	no change in peripheral pharmacokinetics in patients on long-term
	levodopa therapy. The reduced capacity for presynaptic storage of
	dopamine by nigral neurons is believed to be another important factor
	responsible for motor fluctuations (central pharmacokinetics). In
	addition, a mathematical model that was recently established based
	on the hypothesis that dopamine release is subject to probabilistic
	variations in the quantity of dopamine has indicated that motor fluctuations
	might be explained by presynaptic mechanisms. On the other hand,
	several studies demonstrated that changes in postsynaptic mechanisms
	(pharmacodynamics) play an important role in shortening the duration
	of levodopa action in advanced stages. In clinical practice therapeutic
	strategies for motor fluctuations are focused on continuous dopaminergic
	stimulation at postsynaptic dopamine receptors. Once motor fluctuations
	appear, therapeutic regimens should be individualized to retain optimal
	control of the symptoms based on accurate assessment of each patient's
	levodopa cycle and responses to drugs. Symptom diaries kept by patients
	or caregivers are useful for this purpose.},

  abstract = {Parkinson's disease is classified as a chronic movement disorder.
	The incidence of Parkinson's disease is proportional to age. The
	status of Parkinson's disease is characterized through the Unified
	Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The Unified Parkinson's Disease
	Rating Scale is an ordinal scale, for which the scale is qualitatively
	evaluated. The inherent issue of the ordinal scale is the lack of
	a temporal parameter to evaluate the attributes of the movement disorder.
	The evaluation of the Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale requires clinical
	specialization, occurring in a clinical environment. Accelerometers,
	through the advent of miniaturization, have reached a capacity to
	advance the evaluation of Parkinson's disease. Tremor characteristics
	and temporal attributes of Parkinson's disease can be readily quantified.
	Accelerometer systems have been tested and evaluated for ascertaining
	general status, drug therapy efficacy, and amelioration of Parkinson's
	disease based on deep brain stimulation parameter settings. Further
	advance of the accelerometer characterization of Parkinson's disease
	attributes involves the incorporation of a fully wearable system.
	Such a system is possible with the integration of wireless {3D} {MEMS}
	accelerometers. The device proposed incorporates a wireless and potentially
	wearable {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer mounted on the dorsum of the hand.
	The wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer system can potentially track
	the Parkinson's disease status through out real time for a subject
	at the home-based setting of the subject. An implication of the device
	is a subject database can be generated quantifying the progression
	of Parkinson's disease. Drug therapy dosage may be optimized with
	quantified feedback from the wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer system.
	Deep brain stimulation parameters may be further refined, and the
	conceptual foundation for real time deep brain stimulation parameter
	optimization is established. Enclosed is the initial test and evaluati-
	- on of the wireless {3D} {MEMS} accelerometer system through the
	quantification of simulated tremor.},

	is traditionally classified through ordinal scale strategies, such

	The initial testing and evaluation of the {iPhone} wireless accelerometer

	the influence of the {PET} method on the assessment of rate of progression
	and preclinical period. {METHODS—Thirty} two patients with Parkinson's
	disease (mean age 58 ({SD} 13) years, mean duration 39 ({SD} 33)
	months) were assessed with [{18F]dopa} {PET} and {UPDRS} scoring
	on two occasions a mean of 18 ({SD} 6) months apart. {PET} data were
	sampled with separate caudate and putamen and total striatal regions
	of interest, and both graphical (Ki) and ratio methods of analysis. {RESULTS—The}
	mean annual rate of deterioration in [{18F]dopa} uptake varied according
	to structure and method of analysis, with putamen Ki showing the
	most rapid mean rate of progression (4.7\% of normal mean per year).
	The group showed a significant deterioration (p{\textless}0.0004,
	paired two tailed t test) in {UPDRS} and in the putamen (p=0.008)
	and total striatal (p=0.012) [{18F]dopa} uptake measured using a
	graphical analysis, but no significant change in caudate or putamen
	uptake measured by a ratio approach. A study of sensitivity confirmed
	that putamen Ki was the most sensitive measure of disease progression,
	caudate ratio the least. Symptom onset in Parkinson's disease was
	estimated at a mean putamen [{18F]dopa} uptake (Ki) of 75\% of normal
	and a mean caudate [{18F]dopa} uptake (Ki) of 91\% of normal. {CONCLUSIONS—Estimation}
	of mean rate of progression varies according to the sensitivity of
	a functional imaging method to clinical severity. Sensitivity and
	reproducibility of method must be considered when designing studies
	of disease progression and neuroprotection. The mean preclinical
	period in Parkinson's disease is unlikely to be longer than seven

  review = {Objetivo: This paper presents the results of a pilot study to assess
	the feasibility of using accelerometer data to estimate the severity
	of symptoms and motor complications in patients with Parkinson’s
	disease. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was implemented
	to estimate the severity of tremor, bradykinesia and dyskinesia from
	accelerometer data features. SVM-based estimates were compared with
	clinical scores derived via visual inspection of video recordings
	taken while patients performed a series of standardized motor tasks.
	O termo acinesia refere-se à redução da quantidade de movimento enquanto
	que bradicinesia significa lentidão na execução do movimento. O paciente
	apresenta redução da movimentação espontânea em todas as esferas.
	Introdução ----------------- PARKINSON’s disease affects about 3%
	of the population over the age of 65 years and more than 500,000
	U.S. residents. The characteristic motor features of the disease
	include tremor, bradykinesia (i.e., slowness of movement), rigidity
	(i.e., resistance to externally imposed movements), and impaired
	postural balance. motivo da doença -----------------------------
	The primary biochemical abnormality in Parkinson’s disease is a deficiency
	of dopamine due to degeneration of neurons in the substantia nigra
	pars compacta. Tratamento ------------------ Current therapy is based
	on augmentation or replacement of dopamine, using the biosynthetic
	precursor levodopa or drugs that activate dopamine receptors [1].
	Problemas do Tratamento -----------------------------------------
	These therapies are successful for some time, but most patients eventually
	develop motor complications [2]. Complications include wearing-off,
	the abrupt loss of efficacy at the end of each dosing interval, and
	dyskinesias, involuntary and, at times, violent writhing movements.
	Wearing-off and dysk- inesias produce substantial disability, and
	frequently interfere with medical therapies [3], [4]. Motivação da
	Aplicação ------------------------------------- Furthermore, variations
	in the severity of symptoms and motor complications (referred to
	as “motor fluctuations”) are observed during dosing intervals. Currently
	available tools for monitoring motor fluctuations are limited [5],
	[6]. In clinical practice, information about motor fluctuations is
	usually obtained by asking patients to recall the number of hours
	of ON (i.e., when medications effectively attenuate tremor) and OFF
	time (i.e., when medications are not effective). This kind of self-report
	is subject to perceptual bias (e.g., patients often have difficulty
	distinguishing dyskinesia from other symptoms) and recall bias. Another
	approach is the use of patient diaries, which can improve reliability
	by recording symptoms as they occur, but does not capture many of
	the features useful in clinical decision making [7]. Despite recent
	advances in wearable technology [17] and the development of software
	that optimizes the use of resources in body sensor networks [18],
	[19], the use of low-power radios based on the IEEE 802.15.4 standard
	that has been adopted for implementing the majority of the available
	body sensor networks is still marked by excessive power consumption
	thus preventing long-term monitoring of patients unless one implements
	ad hoc strategies. To decrease power consumption requirements, our
	research team and others have pursued solutions that minimize the
	amount of information to be transferred wirelessly from the nodes
	to the base station of the monitoring system. This goal can be met
	by extracting (on the body sensor network nodes) and wirelessly transmitting
	features estimated from the raw data, instead of transmitting the
	raw data itself. Uma limitação dos trabalhos anteriores foi a dificuldade
	de desenvolver um sistema para monitorar os pacientes com parkinson
	integrando os algoritmos propostas para estimar a severidade e complicações
	dos sintomas motores de parkinson com a computação vestível. Outra
	limitação dos trabalhos anteriores foi o foco em sintomas únicos
	como trmores ou uma complicação motoro dyskinesia. O gerenciamento
	clínico da doença de parkinson requer uma complexa interação com
	os medicamentos dos múltimpos sintomas, motores e as as complicações
	monitoradas ao longo do tempo, avaliadas e integradas em algoritimos
	de gerênciamento clínico desses pacientes. COLETA DE DADOS ===========
	Doze indivíduos foram recrutados e estudados com idades entre 46
	a 75 anos, diagnosticados com doença de Parkinson idiopática. Os
	sujeitdos ingerem seu primeiro medicamento pela manhã quando eles
	fazem e testam definindo como estado "OFF". Essa abordagem é usado
	para observar o paciente durante os sintomas motores mais severos.
	Os sujeitos são instruídos para avaliar o padrão das tarefas motoras
	utilizados clinicamente para avaliar os pacientes com doença de parkinson.
	These motor tasks are part of the motor section of the Unified Parkinson’s
	Disease Rating Scale ~\cite{updrs} and included finger-to-nose (reaching
	and touching a target), finger tapping, repeated hand movements (opening
	and closing both hands), heel tapping, quiet sitting, and alternating
	hand movements (repeated pronation/supination movements of the forearms).
	Fig. 1 shows pictures taken during the execution of these tasks.
	After completion of the baseline trial, subjects took their medications
	and were then tested using the same procedure every 30 min. Data
	was collected during seven trials performed at intervalsof 30 min.
	Video recordings were made during each trial so that a clinical evaluation
	of the severity of tremor, bradykinesia, and dyskinesia could be
	performed later on. A clinical expert examined the video recordings
	and provided clinical scores representing the severity of tremor,
	dyskinesia, and bradykinesia for each motor task performed by patients
	during each trial. Such assessment relied upon the Unified Parkinson’s
	Disease Rating Scale [20], which provides five discrete levels of
	severity ranging from 0 to 4. Clinical scores provided by clinicians
	via visual examination of the video recordings were compared with
	estimates derived from the accelerometer data using the methods described
	in the following sections. Leitura dos Gráficos -------------------------------

	eligible for study inclusion (n = 412) had early idiopathic Parkinson's

	daily) or levodopa (100 to 600 mg/day) titrated over a maximum period
	of 24 weeks. Once the optimum or maximum tolerated dose was achieved,
	it was maintained up to the end-point (development of motor complications
	confirmed at 2 consecutive 3-month visits) or up to a minimum of
	3 years' treatment. Open labelled levodopa was added in both treatment
	arms when the improvement in motor disability [Unified Parkinson's
	Disease Rating Scale ({UPDRS)} factor {III]} decreased below 30\%
	vs baseline. Both treatments improved motor disability, decreasing
	{UPDRS} factor {III} scores and factor {II} scores for activities
	of daily living. The development of motor complications (end-point)
	was significantly less frequent in patients treated with cabergoline
	than in levodopa recipients (22\% vs 34\%; p {\textless} 0.02). The
	relative risk of developing motor complications during treatment
	with cabergoline was more than 50\% lower than with levodopa. Serious
	adverse events, either drug related or not, were slightly more frequent
	in cabergoline-treated patients (31\%) than in those treated with
	levodopa (25\%). The withdrawal rate in the cabergoline vs levodopa

	of patient privacy without compromising their safety. Current solutions
	have two main limitations: (1) they require an extensive exchange
	of messages among patient's caregivers and devices in order to protect
	data, and (2) they depend on using data decryption keys that must
	be provided to specific caregivers. The second limitation compromises
	safety of patients who need urgent help while their ad hoc caregivers
	have no access to their health data (since they have no needed decryption
	keys). This paper proposes an approach for protecting privacy of
	patients based on active bundles. An active bundle encapsulates sensitive
	data, metadata, and a virtual machine. In healthcare monitoring systems,
	"sensitive data" are monitored health data. To avoid compromising
	of safety of patients who need urgent help, our approach does not
	depend on the use of decryption keys provided to specific caregivers
	(which is a commonly used approach). Instead, it combines the use
	of privacy policies and protection mechanisms included within active
	bundles, such as evaporation and apoptosis. In our approach, ad hoc
	caregivers are able to access urgently needed patients' data. Their
	authorizations are provided via privacy policies encapsulated in
	metadata of an active bundle including health data.},

  abstract = {Overweight and obesity has doubled among children in Australia. There
	is an urgent need to develop primary prevention strategies to prevent
	current and future unhealthy weight gain. The aims of this paper
	are to describe a randomized controlled trial ({‘Switch-Play’)} developed
	to prevent unhealthy weight gain among 10-year-old children and to
	report the findings of the process evaluation. Children from three
	government primary schools were randomized by class to one of four
	conditions: a behavioural modification group ({BM;} n = 69); a fundamental
	motor skills group ({FMS;} n = 73); a combined {BM} and {FMS} group
	(n = 90); or a control (usual classroom lessons) group (n = 61).
	Children in the {BM} group participated in 19 sessions that encouraged
	them to reduce screen-based behaviours, and identified physical activity
	alternatives. The {FMS} group participated in 19 lessons that focused
	on mastery of six skills: run, throw, dodge, strike, vertical jump
	and kick. The combined group participated in all the {BM} and {FMS}
	activities. The intervention specialist teacher reported that the
	children showed high enjoyment and engagement (88\% lessons attended)
	in most aspects of the programme. At-home tasks were completed by
	57–62\% of the children, and 92\% completed the in-class tasks. Two-thirds
	of the children in the {BM} group participated in the behavioural
	contracting to switch off the {TV.} Most of the children reported
	high enjoyment of the programmes, and only a small proportion (7–17\%)
	reported difficulties in switching off their nominated {TV} shows.
	More than half the children reported reducing their {TV} viewing;
	however, less than half reported increasing their physical activity.
	It was found that most aspects of the intervention arms of the programme
	were successfully delivered to the majority of children participating
	in {‘Switch-Play’;} that the programmes were delivered as intended;
	and that the programmes were favourably evaluated by participating
	children and their parents.},

	O artigo fala a respeito de uma ferramenta (Healthcare Aide) que
	foi desenvolvida não apenas para melhorar a relação Doutor-Doutor,
	residente-doutor, paciente-doutor, enfermeira-doutor. Mas também
	ser um caminho mais curto para a tomada de decisões em tempo real.
	Podendo visualizar a situação do paciente de diversos pontos de vista
	através de um conjunto de resultados. Segundo o autor a ferramenta
	proposta por ele "MARKS" (Middleware Adaptability for Resource Discovery,
	Knowledge Usability and Self- healing) provê um grande suporte na
	assistência médica e de maneira bastante transparente. O principal
	objetivo da pervasive health care é prover serviço de assistência
	médica para todos a qualquer momento, independente de lugar, tempo
	e disponibilidade de profissionais da saúde. Os profissionais da
	saúde precisam acessar as informação do paciente assim como postar
	suas próprias conclusões a respeito do estado de saúde atual. O artigo
	fala a respeito de números sobre o uso de handhelds entre os profissionais
	da saúde e pacientes. O projeto MARKS, prove um caminho continuo
	no que se refere a assitência ao paciente. Esses benefícios permitirão
	reduzir as chance de erro médico. Características do Healthcare Aide:
	- Mecanismo de segurança para informações sigilosas. - Conectividade
	contínua - Eficiência de energia - Nenhum impacto negativo - Baixo
	uso de memória - Redução de custos - Aplicação concorrente - Serviço
	de descobrimento seguro - Comunicação segura - Autenticação Requisitos
	Funcionais - Visão do ponto de vista Doutor/Doutor 1. Formulário
	contendo todas as informações necessárias sobre o paciente. 2. Doutor
	poder anotar qualquer informação adcional sobre o paciente. 3. Doutor
	poder mandar facilmente toda ou alguma informações sobre o paciente
	para diversas pessoas caso seja o seu desejo. 4. Exceto pelos doutores
	autênticados ninguém poderá acessar as informações do paciente 5.
	Durante a transferência dos dados, assegurar que nenhuma informação
	será vazada, por algum intruso. 6. Os doutores serão obrigados a
	utilizar os meios eletrônicos (computadores e PDAs) para a eficiência
	do sistema. 7. Backup de todas as transações 8. Chat entre os doutores.
	Requisitos do ponto de vista do Residente 9. Alunos de medicina Residentes
	devem ter a possibilidade de baixar informações do paciente caso
	o doutor permita. 10 Alunos residentes podem querer compartilhar
	casos raros e interessantes entre si 11 Comunicar para outro residente
	caso tenha aviso alteração no horário do plantão. Desenvolvimento
	da aplicação O auto demonstrou a arquitetura da aplicação e telas
	da aplicação desenvolvida para Windows CE. A aplicação é bem simples
	com poucas telas, a meu ver falta um pouco de praticidade. Trabalhos
	relacionados: CodeBlue project - Universidade de Havard http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~mdw/proj/codeblue/
	Conclusão Esse é um primeiro protótipo da aplicação, para o autor
	houve efetividade no atendimento dos pacientes. E como trabalho futuro
	ele deseja inserir recursos de voz para o reconhecimento de caracteres.

  abstract = {Accurate diagnosis and individualized assessment of the risks and
	benefits of available antiparkinsonian medications should guide initiation
	of treatment for patients with early Parkinson's disease ({PD).}
	In general, the goals of treatment for younger patients (less than
	age 60 years) are control of impairing symptoms, sparing of levodopa
	to minimize long-term complications, and consideration of neuroprotection.
	The primary initial medication choices for patients under age 50
	years include selegiline, amantadine, and anticholinergic agents.
	Patients in their fifties may require a dopamine agonist in addition
	to or instead of selegiline to achieve adequate symptom control.
	If the desired response is still not achieved, sustained-release
	carbidopa-levodopa should be added, followed by adjunctive amantadine
	or anticholinergic therapy. For older patients (60 years and over),
	improvement of functional impairment is the primary goal. For these
	patients, a special concern is to avoid inducing or exacerbating
	cognitive impairment. Sustained-release carbidopa-levodopa is considered
	first-line treatment for these patients. Inadequate response can
	be handled by a trial of immediate-release carbidopa-levodopa and
	then addition of a dopamine agonist when maximum levodopa doses are
	reached. Anticholinergic agents, amantadine, and selegiline should
	be avoided because of their {CNS} effects.},

  review = {Trabalho mais voltado para crianças. Children nowadays spend less
	time performing physical activities, and spend more time in front
	of the television, watching DVD’s, and playing video games [Salmon
	et al. 2005]. Engagement in these activities steals time that was
	previously spent on physical activity in prior generations. Children
	aged 8 to 18 spend more time in front of computer, television, and
	game screens (44.5 hours per week) than any other activity in their
	lives except sleeping [Kaiser 2005]. Vandewater et al. A tese de
	mestrado de luke faz uma análise do consumo de oxigênio e o batimento
	cardíaco. em resposta a todo o corpo. Eses dispositivos foram utilizados
	para fazer e medição de diversas sessões durante o jogo. No traabalho
	de mestrado de Hoysniemi, ela faz uma avalição dos jogos interativos
	físicos. Nesse estudo ela faz importantes questionamentos de como
	poderia desenvolver jogos interativos. Yannakakis examinou as diferentes
	plataformas de jogos. E demonstrou que a fantasia é um fator que
	deixa os jogos mais divertidos para os jogadores. Entretanto, um
	balanceamento entre o desafio e a curiosidade são dependentes do
	jogador. Essa idéia de atração do jogo corrobora com a teoria de
	Cizkzzentmihalyi. DEBRA lieberman fala que os jogadores usam os jogos
	enquanto é divertido. Se deixarem de usar os jogos quando não estiverem
	mais em diversão então o tratamento passa a não ser efetivo. Flow
	is the state of total engagement in an activity. It is the equivalent
	to what is called in the sporting world “being in the zone”. There
	are nine components of the experience of “flow”: 1. Balance between
	perceived skills and perceived challenge (the activity is neither
	too easy nor too difficult). 2. The merging of action and awareness.
	3. Clear goals (expectations and rules are discernible and goals
	are attainable and align appropriately with one’s skill set and abilities).
	4. Unambiguous feedback (successes and failures in the course of
	the activity are apparent, so that behaviour can be adjusted as needed).
	5. Concentrating and focusing, a high degree of concentration on
	a limited field of attention (a person engaged in the activity will
	have the opportunity to focus and to delve deeply into it). 6. A
	sense of personal control over the situation or activity. 7. A loss
	of the feeling of self-consciousness (no feelings of selfdoubt or
	self-concern). 8. Transformation of time (one’s subjective experience
	of time is altered). 9. Autotelic experience (the activity is intrinsically
	rewarding - it is undertaken for its own sake). When in the flow
	state, people become absorbed in their activity, and focus of awareness
	is narrowed down to the activity itself, action and awareness merging.(
	[Csikszentmihalyi 1975, p. 72]). Sweetseer fez uma teoria dos fluxos
	para o domínio de jogos: Essas características de fluxo devem ser
	elementos controlados diretamente pelo game designer para afetar
	o estado do jogador, esses elementos são artefatos do estado de fluxo.
	Concentração, perda da consciência, e perda de espaço e tempo são
	parâmetros que o jogador deverão estar quando este estiver se divertindo.
	Nunca esqueça, que o design de um exergames deve levar em consideração
	ambas as categorias, exercício físico diversão e ainda não extender
	o jogo demais para evitar fadiga ou lesões. Esse gráfico da atratividade
	e efetividade do exergames é bastante interessante e define bem o
	conjunto do trabalho. Balanço na efetividade se não for levado em
	consideração a atividade física do participante, pode inabilitá-lo
	de continuar a praticar atividade física. O ponto chave desse modelo
	de fluxo duplo é o balanceamento entre as atividades físicas e o
	desafio proposto ao jogador.},

  abstract = {An increasing amount of health-related games are available, in which
	health enhancement is included either by having health topics as
	educational content, making players move physically, or by combinations
	of these approaches in various degrees. Heuristic evaluation is widely
	used as a low-cost expert evaluation method in software and game
	development for assessing usability problems. The goal of our research
	was to assess how modular playability heuristics work in the evaluation
	of different types of health games. Based on a literature review
	we collected a sixmodule set of playability heuristics. Three different
	games with direct or indirect health enhancing effects were evaluated
	with the derived set of heuristics. The results suggest that playability
	heuristics are useful in evaluating various types of healthenhancing
	games, provided that the heuristic modules chosen for the evaluation

	de jogabilidade são úteis para avaliar o melhoramento da saúde através
	do jogos. Foi sugeriodo dois novos módulos de heurísticas para desenvolver
	jogos de saúde a partir daas características do health games. Federoff
	baseado nas heurísticas de Nielsen avalia os jogos e proõe novas
	heurística para jogos. O objetivo desse trabalho é avaliar 3 tipos
	diferentes de jogos (Wii Tennis, Jogo Online) e descrever o uso das
	heurísticas em detalhe. Segundo o autor a jogabilidade é o coração
	do jogo. Um problema encontrado com as heurísticas é que elas devem
	ser endereçadas para diferente tipos de jogos com diferentes gêneros
	e características. O mais útil é criar heurísticas que sirvam para
	todos os jogos. Para êncioa do jogos de Wii o uso do controle é um
	predominante, será que a heurística de usar ese controle pormove
	a experia de jogos físicos e com multimodalidade. Conclusão ----------------
	O propósito desse trabalho é estudar como heurísticas modulares de
	6 categoras distintas coletadas da literatura podem trabalhar para
	avaliar três tipos de jogos de saúde. Baseado nesse estudo foi proposto
	as heurísticas baseadas na: - Multimodalidade; - PERSUASÃO ------------------
	Muitos jogos de saúde possuem essas características e a existência
	dessa heurística pode benegficar o desenvolvimento de jogos para
	saúde ou que demonstrem conteúdo. =============== Baixar Persuasive

	para exercício físico como também tentam mudar a consciência dos
	usuários para uma vida mais saudável. Através dos dispostivos de
	sensores de movimento o uso de jogos se tornou uma forma promissora
	de promoção da saúde e bem-estar. O número de jogos comerciais bem
	como serviços de Internet móvel relacionados com a saúde e bem-estar
	tem crescido rapidamente nos últimos anos. Especialmente exergames,
	ou seja, jogos que combinam exercícios com jogos, ganharam aumento
	atenção por pesquisadores na promoção da atividade física e consequentemente,
	a saúde ~\cite{baran08}. Partindo da enfase na importancia social
	dos jogos, off-line e multiplayer. Foram catalogados as implicações
	de design para jogos que promovam a saúde. Exergames como DDR (Dance
	Dance Revolution), Wii Sports e Guitar Hero têm-se tornado extremamente

	jogos móveis promovem a saúde como Noliaś Wellness Diary and Sports

	a saúde devem ser: divertidos, imersivos e engajados. Um jogo para
	ser considerado sério, tem que privilegiar o seu propósito de educação,
	monitoramento ou acompanhamento ao invés da jogabilidade. Trabalhos
	Relacionados ------------------------------------- Para Massively
	Multiplayer Role-Playing Games (MMORPG), Yee [20] divide a motivação
	dos jogos on-line em três dimensões: realização, imersão e sociabilizadade.
	A realização consiste em atingir os objetivos, fazendo progresso
	de nível e ganhando poderes e de forma paralela competir com outros
	jogadores, assim como entender as regras e mecânica do jogo. Os subfatores
	de imersão são descoberta, RPG, customização e escapismo. Escapismo
	é sobre como usar o jogo ambiente como um lugar para relaxar, enquanto
	explora o mundo do jogo e suas localizações, informações e artefatos.
	O fator de sociabilidade é composto de socializar, conhecer e colaborar
	com outros jogadores. Também formando relações mais significativas
	com outras pessoas, lidar com questões da vida real e os problemas
	podem motivar os jogadores. Socializar com os outros também aumentando
	o nível de interação através de um jogo. [20] Métodos -------------
	Foram coletados através de um web survey as tecnologias utilizadas
	para jogar. Havia 128 entrevistados na pesquisa da web, que foram
	para a setima e nona série de duas escolas grau completo. a maioria
	(125) dos respondentes eram 13-16 anos (média de 14,52, std. 1,04)
	e 72 (56%) dos entrevistados eram meninas e 56 (44%) meninos. A pesquisa
	web cobriu por exemplo, a frequência e tipo de tecnologia utilizada,
	bem como os hábitos de jogo, preferências, motivações e aspectos
	importantes no jogo, que foi medido por um de 5 pontos Escala de
	Likert ancorada em 1 (muito importante) e 5 (muito importante). Os
	resultados da pesquisa foram analisados ​​usando web métodos estatísticos
	de análise, tais como freqüências e distribuições. Quatro jogos relacionados
	com a saúde, dos quais dois foram jogos online, uma era um jogo para
	celular e um foi um exergame, foram selecionados para avaliações.
	Cada par jogado um jogo durante a avaliação sessão. As notas de entrevista
	e observação foram transcritas e foram analisadas com o método de
	análise de conteúdo. Segundo a pesquisa da Web, aspectos importantes
	no jogo, além de jogar na companhia de amigos, estavam progredindo
	em um jogo (muito importante: 36%), relaxante (muito importante:

  abstract = {Although player enjoyment is central to computer games, there is currently
	no accepted model of player enjoyment in games. There are many heuristics
	in the literature, based on elements such as the game interface,
	mechanics, gameplay, and narrative. However, there is a need to integrate
	these heuristics into a validated model that can be used to design,
	evaluate, and understand enjoyment in games. We have drawn together
	the various heuristics into a concise model of enjoyment in games
	that is structured by flow. Flow, a widely accepted model of enjoyment,
	includes eight elements that, we found, encompass the various heuristics
	from the literature. Our new model, GameFlow, consists of eight elements
	-- concentration, challenge, skills, control, clear goals, feedback,
	immersion, and social interaction. Each element includes a set of
	criteria for achieving enjoyment in games. An initial investigation
	and validation of the GameFlow model was carried out by conducting
	expert reviews of two real-time strategy games, one high-rating and
	one low-rating, using the GameFlow criteria. The result was a deeper
	understanding of enjoyment in real-time strategy games and the identification
	of the strengths and weaknesses of the GameFlow model as an evaluation
	tool. The GameFlow criteria were able to successfully distinguish
	between the high-rated and low-rated games and identify why one succeeded
	and the other failed. We concluded that the GameFlow model can be
	used in its current form to review games; further work will provide
	tools for designing and evaluating enjoyment in games.},

	Permanente Medical Care Program of Northern California, a large health
	maintenance organization. Each case met modified standardized criteria/Hughes

	Incidence rates per 100,000 person-years were calculated using the
	Kaiser Permanente membership information as the denominator and adjusted
	for age and/or gender using the direct method of standardization.
	A total of 588 newly diagnosed (incident) cases of Parkinson’s disease
	were identified, which gave an overall annualized age- and gender-adjusted
	incidence rate of 13.4 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval (CI):
	11.4, 15.5). The incidence rapidly increased over the age of 60 years,
	with only 4% of the cases being under the age of 50 years. The rate
	for men (19.0 per 100,000, 95% CI: 16.1, 21.8) was 91% higher than
	that for women (9.9 per 100,000, 95% CI: 7.6, 12.2). The age- and

  abstract = {Human daily activity recognition using mobile personal sensing technology
	plays a central role in the field of pervasive healthcare. One major
	challenge lies in the inherent complexity of human body movements
	and the variety of styles when people perform a certain activity.
	To tackle this problem, in this paper, we present a novel human activity
	recognition framework based on recently developed compressed sensing
	and sparse representation theory using wearable inertial sensors.
	Our approach represents human activity signals as a sparse linear
	combination of activity signals from all activity classes in the
	training set. The class membership of the activity signal is determined
	by solving a l1 minimization problem. We experimentally validate
	the effectiveness of our sparse representation-based approach by
	recognizing nine most common human daily activities performed by
	14 subjects. Our approach achieves a maximum recognition rate of
	96.1%, which beats conventional methods based on nearest neighbor,
	naive Bayes, and support vector machine by as much as 6.7%. Furthermore,
	we demonstrate that by using random projection, the task of looking
	for “optimal features” to achieve the best activity recognition performance
	is less important within our framework.},
