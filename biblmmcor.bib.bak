  abstract = {Advancements are being made towards a cheap and effective means for
	health monitoring. A mobile monitoring system is proposed for monitoring
	a bicycle rider using light weight, low power wireless sensors. Biometric
	and environmental information pertaining to the bicycle rider is
	captured, transmitted to, and stored in a remote database with little
	user interaction required. Remote users have real time access to
	the captured information through a web application. Possible applications
	for this system include the monitoring of a soldier in the battlefield
	and the monitoring of a patient during an ambulance ride.},
