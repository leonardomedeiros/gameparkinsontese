  Abstract                 = {The paper presents a Multi-class Support Vector Machine classifier and its application to hypothyroid detection and classification. Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been well known method in the machine learning community for binary classification problems. Multi-class SVMs (MCSVM) are usually implemented by combining several binary SVMs. The objective of this work is to show: first, robustness of various kind of kernels for Multi-class SVM classifier, second, a comparison of different constructing methods for Multi-class SVM, such as One-Against-One and One-Against-All, and finally comparing the classifiers' accuracy of Multi-class SVM classifier to AdaBoost and Decision Tree. The simulation results show that One-Against-All Support Vector Machines (OAASVM) are superior to One-Against-One Support Vector Machines (OAOSVM) with polynomial kernels. The accuracy of OAASVM is also higher than AdaBoost and Decision Tree classifier on hypothyroid disease datasets from UCI machine learning dataset.},

  Abstract                 = {Advancements are being made towards a cheap and effective means for health monitoring. A mobile monitoring system is proposed for monitoring a bicycle rider using light weight, low power wireless sensors. Biometric and environmental information pertaining to the bicycle rider is captured, transmitted to, and stored in a remote database with little user interaction required. Remote users have real time access to the captured information through a web application. Possible applications for this system include the monitoring of a soldier in the battlefield and the monitoring of a patient during an ambulance ride.},
