%Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a degenerative neurological disorder. It causes motor symptoms such as resting tremor, bradykinesia and gait disorders. The disease’s progressive nature requires continuous monitoring of the motor symptoms to assist the neurologist in managing medication. With this purpose, Health Monitoring Systems (HMS) are used as a decentralized healthcare approach. On the other hand, most patients reject the current HMS solutions because they are invasive and stigmatizing. In this work, we present a non-invasive HMS for PD motor symptoms based on games. Because of the nature of games, the approach is able to collect data from patients without reminding them that they are under a disease’s treatment. We validated our approach with 30 research subjects divided between PD group and Control group. We used Support Vector Machine (SVM) to identify the occurrence of PD’s bradykinesia motor symptoms and reached a classification accuracy of 86.66\%\. Furthermore, 90\%\ of the patients approved our 
%HMS considering it as non-invasive and easily integrated into their routine.

Health Monitoring Systems (HMS) can improve users' life quality by remotely providing information regarding their health, enabling early identification of potential critical situations. On the other hand, developing a non-invasive health monitoring system for motor data is a multidisciplinary challenge. These systems, despite technology advancements, are still invasive and stereotyped, what makes difficult their dissemination. So, these systems have not been applied to the users daily activities, undermining motor symptoms monitoring.

This work proposes the use of video games
to motivate and disregard health monitoring, integrating it in users daily routine. The proposed approach allows integrating the HMS architecture to electronic games that use motion detection sensors to capture users' kinetic actions. This way, the user performs specific movements inside the context of an electronic game that quantifies motion signals and monitors health.

To validate the approach, we performed a case-control analytic study to detect individuals diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease (PD) using motion capturing sensors through video games. We evaluated health data acquisition possibilities based on Human Motion Angular Kinetic characteristics. The data was applied in a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify the data. As a result, we had an accuracy rate of 86.67\% true positive identification and 6.67\% rate of false positive. This way, we concluded that the proposed approach allows developing video games to monitor motion data non-invasively.
