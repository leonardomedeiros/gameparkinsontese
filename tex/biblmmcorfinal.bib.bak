The pervasive healthcare systems provide rich contextual information and alerting mechanisms against odd conditions with continuous monitoring. This minimizes the need for caregivers and helps the chronically ill and elderly to survive an independent life, besides provides quality care for the babies and little children whose both parents have to work. Although having significant benefits, the area has still major challenges which are investigated in this paper. We provide several state of the art examples together with the design considerations like unobtrusiveness, scalability, energy efficiency, security and also provide a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and challenges of these systems.},

  abstract     = {Analysis of human behaviour for deducing health and well-being information is one of the contemporary challenges given the ageing in place. To this end, existing and newly developed machine learning methods are needed to be evaluated using annotated real-world data sets. However, the metrics used in performance evaluation are directly taken from the machine learning domain, and they do not necessarily consider the specific needs of human behaviour analysis such as recognizing the duration, start time and frequency of the activities. Moreover, the commonly used metrics such as accuracy or F-measure can be misleading in the presence of skewed class distributions as in the case of human behaviour recognition. In this study, we evaluate the performance of two machine learning methods, hidden Markov model and time windowed neural network on five different real-world data sets through human behaviour understanding for health assessment perspective. According to the experimental results, standard metrics fail to reveal the actual performance of the two compared machine learning methods in terms of behaviour recognition. On the other hand, the proposed evaluation mechanism which considers three different activity categories leads to a more realistic evaluation of the overall performance.},

  abstract     = {Objectives: The aging of the population creates pressure on the healthcare systems in various ways. A massive increase of chronic disease conditions and age-related illness are predicted as the dominant forces driving the future health care. The objective of this paper is to present future research demands in pervasive healthcare with the goal to meet the healthcare challenges by paving the way for a pervasive, user-centered and preventive healthcare model.
Methods: This paper presents recent methodological approaches and proposes future research topics in three areas: i) pervasive, continuous and reliable long-term monitoring systems; ii) prevention through pervasive technology as a key element to maintain lifelong wellness; and iii) design and evaluation methods for ubiquitous, patient-centric technologies.
Results: Pervasive technology has been identified as a strong asset for achieving the vision of user-centered preventive healthcare. In order to make this vision a reality, new strategies for design, development and evaluation of technology have to find a common denominator and consequently interoperate. Moreover, the potential of pervasive healthcare technologies offers new opportunities beyond traditional disease treatment and may play a major role in prevention, e.g. motivate healthy behavior and disease prevention throughout all stages of life. In this sense, open challenges in future research have to be addressed such as the variability of health indicators between individuals and the manner in which relevant health indicators are provided to the users in order to maximize their motivation to mitigate or prevent unhealthy behaviors. Additionally, collecting evidence that pervasive technology improves health is seen as one of the toughest challenges. Promising approaches are recently introduced, such as "clinical proof-of-concept" and balanced observational studies.
Conclusions: The paper concludes that pervasive healthcare will enable a paradigm shift from the established centralized healthcare model to a pervasive, user-centered and preventive overall lifestyle health management. In order to provide these new opportunities everywhere, anytime and to anyone, future research in the fields of pervasive sensing, pervasive prevention and evaluation of pervasive technology is inevitably needed.},

research study aims to develop a game based system enhancing
