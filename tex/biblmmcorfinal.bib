The pervasive healthcare systems provide rich contextual information and alerting mechanisms against odd conditions with continuous monitoring. This minimizes the need for caregivers and helps the chronically ill and elderly to survive an independent life, besides provides quality care for the babies and little children whose both parents have to work. Although having significant benefits, the area has still major challenges which are investigated in this paper. We provide several state of the art examples together with the design considerations like unobtrusiveness, scalability, energy efficiency, security and also provide a comprehensive analysis of the benefits and challenges of these systems.},

To this end, existing and newly developed machine learning methods are needed to be evaluated using annotated real-world data sets. However, the metrics used in performance evaluation are directly taken from the machine learning domain, and they do not necessarily consider the specific needs of human behaviour analysis such as recognizing the duration, start time and frequency of the activities. Moreover, the commonly used metrics such as accuracy or F-measure can be misleading in the presence of skewed class distributions as in the case of human behaviour recognition. In this study, we evaluate the performance of two machine learning methods, hidden Markov model and time windowed neural network on five different real-world data sets through human behaviour understanding for health assessment perspective. According to the experimental results, standard metrics fail to reveal the actual performance of the two compared machine learning methods in terms of behaviour recognition. On the other hand, the proposed evaluation mechanism which considers three different activity categories leads to a more realistic evaluation of the overall performance.},

  abstract     = {Objectives: The aging of the population creates pressure on the healthcare systems in various ways. A massive increase of chronic disease conditions and age-related illness are predicted as the dominant forces driving the future health care. The objective of this paper is to present future research demands in pervasive healthcare with the goal to meet the healthcare challenges by paving the way for a pervasive, user-centered and preventive healthcare model.
Methods: This paper presents recent methodological approaches and proposes future research topics in three areas: i) pervasive, continuous and reliable long-term monitoring systems; ii) prevention through pervasive technology as a key element to maintain lifelong wellness; and iii) design and evaluation methods for ubiquitous, patient-centric technologies.
Results: Pervasive technology has been identified as a strong asset for achieving the vision of user-centered preventive healthcare. In order to make this vision a reality, new strategies for design, development and evaluation of technology have to find a common denominator and consequently interoperate. Moreover, the potential of pervasive healthcare technologies offers new opportunities beyond traditional disease treatment and may play a major role in prevention, e.g. motivate healthy behavior and disease prevention throughout all stages of life. In this sense, open challenges in future research have to be addressed such as the variability of health indicators between individuals and the manner in which relevant health indicators are provided to the users in order to maximize their motivation to mitigate or prevent unhealthy behaviors. Additionally, collecting evidence that pervasive technology improves health is seen as one of the toughest challenges. Promising approaches are recently introduced, such as "clinical proof-of-concept" and balanced observational studies.
Conclusions: The paper concludes that pervasive healthcare will enable a paradigm shift from the established centralized healthcare model to a pervasive, user-centered and preventive overall lifestyle health management. In order to provide these new opportunities everywhere, anytime and to anyone, future research in the fields of pervasive sensing, pervasive prevention and evaluation of pervasive technology is inevitably needed.},

This paper describes the “manumeter,” a device that logs total angular distance travelled by wrist and finger joints using a magnetic ring worn on the index finger and two triaxial magnetometers mounted in a watch-like unit. We describe an approach to estimate the wrist and finger joint angles using a radial basis function network that maps differential magnetometer readings to joint angles. We tested this approach by comparing manumeter estimates of total angular excursion with those from a passive goniometric exoskeleton worn simultaneously as seven participants completed a set of 12 manual tasks at low-, medium-, and high-intensity conditions on a first testing day, 1-2 days later, and 6-8 days later, using only the original calibration from the first testing day. Manumeter estimates scaled proportionally to the intensity of hand activity. Estimates of angular excursion made with the manumeter were 92.5% ± 28.4 (SD), 98.3% ± 23.3, and 94.7% ± 19.3 of the goniometric exoskeleton across the three testing days, respectively. Magnetic sensing of wrist and finger movement is nonobtrusive and can quantify the amount of use of the hand across days.},

Com o progresso terapêutico, desenvolveram-se várias escalas visando monitorar a evolução da doença e a eficácia de tratamentos. O objetivo desta revisão foi caracterizar as principais escalas usadas para avaliação da DP, discutindo sua aplicabilidade à prática fisioterapêutica. As escalas encontradas na literatura foram: a de estágios de incapacidade de Hoehn e Yahr; a Escala Unificada de Avaliação da DP (UPDRS); a escala de Webster de avaliação da DP; a escala de Sydney; a Escala de Incapacidade da Northwestern University (NUDS); os questionários da DP (PDQ-39) e de Qualidade de Vida na DP(PDQL); e a Escala de Atividade de Parkinson (PAS). A Webster permite classificar o paciente de acordo com seu nível de incapacidade, porém não há estudos conclusivos quanto a sua confiabilidade. A Sydney avalia o nível da estrutura e função corporal, enquanto o enfoque da NUDS é nas atividades funcionais diárias. O PDQ-39 e o PDQL são questionários específicos para avaliar a percepção do paciente sobre sua qualidade de vida. Sobre a PAS, desenvolvida recentemente com base em objetivos da fisioterapia, não há estudos suficientes para definir sua confiabilidade. Destacam-se as escalas de Hoehn e Yahr e a UPDRS, por sua confiabilidade, podendo ser usadas por fisioterapeutas para melhor avaliação do estado clínico-funcional do paciente.},

This review describes the clinical characteristics of PD with emphasis on those features that differentiate the disease from other parkinsonian disorders.Methods: A MedLine search was performed to identify studies that assess the clinical characteristics of PD. Search terms included “Parkinson’s disease”, “diagnosis” and “signs and symptoms”.Results: Because there is no definitive test for the diagnosis of PD, the disease must be diagnosed based on clinical criteria. Rest tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity and loss of postural reflexes are generally considered the cardinal signs of PD. The presence and specific presentation of these features are used to differentiate PD from related parkinsonian disorders. Other clinical features include secondary motor symptoms (eg, hypomimia, dysarthria, dysphagia, sialorrhoea, micrographia, shuffling gait, festination, freezing, dystonia, glabellar reflexes), non-motor symptoms (eg, autonomic dysfunction, cognitive/neurobehavioral abnormalities, sleep disorders and sensory abnormalities such as anosmia, paresthesias and pain). Absence of rest tremor, early occurrence of gait difficulty, postural instability, dementia, hallucinations, and the presence of dysautonomia, ophthalmoparesis, ataxia and other atypical features, coupled with poor or no response to levodopa, suggest diagnoses other than PD.Conclusions: A thorough understanding of the broad spectrum of clinical manifestations of PD is essential to the proper diagnosis of the disease. Genetic mutations or variants, neuroimaging abnormalities and other tests are potential biomarkers that may improve diagnosis and allow the identification of persons at risk.},

For this purpose, past and current UPDRS data from 47 subjects were examined.

  abstract  = {Parkinson's disease is classified as a chronic movement disorder. The incidence of Parkinson's disease is proportional to age. The status of Parkinson's disease is characterized through the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale is an ordinal scale, for which the scale is qualitatively evaluated. The inherent issue of the ordinal scale is the lack of a temporal parameter to evaluate the attributes of the movement disorder. The evaluation of the Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale requires clinical specialization, occurring in a clinical environment. Accelerometers, through the advent of miniaturization, have reached a capacity to advance the evaluation of Parkinson's disease. Tremor characteristics and temporal attributes of Parkinson's disease can be readily quantified. Accelerometer systems have been tested and evaluated for ascertaining general status, drug therapy efficacy, and amelioration of Parkinson's disease based on deep brain stimulation parameter settings. Further advance of the accelerometer characterization of Parkinson's disease attributes involves the incorporation of a fully wearable system. Such a system is possible with the integration of wireless 3D MEMS accelerometers. The device proposed incorporates a wireless and potentially wearable 3D MEMS accelerometer mounted on the dorsum of the hand. The wireless 3D MEMS accelerometer system can potentially track the Parkinson's disease status through out real time for a subject at the home-based setting of the subject. An implication of the device is a subject database can be generated quantifying the progression of Parkinson's disease. Drug therapy dosage may be optimized with quantified feedback from the wireless 3D MEMS accelerometer system. Deep brain stimulation parameters may be further refined, and the conceptual foundation for real time deep brain stimulation parameter optimization is established. Enclosed is the initial test and evaluati- - on of the wireless 3D MEMS accelerometer system through the quantification of simulated tremor.},

The status of Parkinson's disease is traditionally classified through ordinal scale strategies, such as the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. However, the application of the ordinal scale strategy inherently requires highly specialized and limited medical resources for interpretation. An alternative strategy involves the implementation of an iPhone application that enables the device to serve as a functional wireless accelerometer system. The Parkinson's disease tremor attributes may be recorded in either an effectively autonomous public or private setting, for which the resultant accelerometer signal of the tremor can be conveyed wireless and through email to a remote location for data post-processing. The initial testing and evaluation of the iPhone wireless accelerometer application for quantifying Parkinson's disease tremor successfully demonstrates the capacity to acquire tremor characteristics in an effectively autonomous environment, while potentially alleviating strain on limited and highly specialized medical resources.},

Nevertheless, the searching range and fineness of the grid method should be determined in advance. In this paper, an automatic method for selecting the parameter of the normalized kernel function is proposed. In the experimental results, it costs very little time than k-fold cross-validation for selecting the parameter by our proposed method.

A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was implemented to estimate the severity of tremor, bradykinesia and dyskinesia from accelerometer data features. SVM-based estimates were compared with clinical scores derived via visual inspection of video recordings taken while patients performed a series of standardized motor tasks. The analysis of the video recordings was performed by clinicians trained in the use of scales for the assessment of the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms and motor complications. Results derived from the accelerometer time series were analyzed to assess the effect on the estimation of clinical scores of the duration of the window utilized to derive segments (to eventually compute data features) from the accelerometer data, the use of different SVM kernels and misclassification cost values, and the use of data features derived from different motor tasks. Results were also analyzed to assess which combinations of data features carried enough information to reliably assess the severity of symptoms and motor complications. Combinations of data features were compared taking into consideration the computational cost associated with estimating each data feature on the nodes of a body sensor network and the effect of using such data features on the reliability of SVM-based estimates of the severity of Parkinsonian symptoms and motor complications.},

  abstract     = {Current clinical methods for the assessment of Parkinson's disease (PD) suffer from inconvenience, infrequency, and subjectivity. WiiPD is an approach for the objective home-based assessment of PD which utilizes the intuitive and sensor-rich Nintendo Wii remote. Combined with an electronic patient diary, a suite of minigames, a metric analyzer, and a visualization engine, we propose that this system can complement existing clinical practice by providing objective metrics gathered frequently over extended periods of time. In this paper, we detail the approach and introduce a series of metrics deemed capable of quantifying the severity of tremor and bradykinesia in those with PD. The system has been tested on a 71-year-old participant with PD over a period of 15 days, a 72-year-old control user without PD, and a group of eight young adults. Results indicate a clear correlation between patient self-rating scores of tremor severity and metric values obtained, in addition to clear differences in metrics obtained from each user group. These results suggest that this approach is capable of indicating the presence and severity of the motor symptoms of PD that affect arm motor control.},

  abstract = {Ambulatory monitoring of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD) can improve our therapeutic strategies, especially in patients with motor fluctuations. Previously published monitors usually assess only one or a few basic aspects of the cardinal motor symptoms in a laboratory setting. We developed a novel ambulatory monitoring system that provides a complete motor assessment by simultaneously analyzing current motor activity of the patient (e.g., sitting, walking, etc.) and the severity of many aspects related to tremor, bradykinesia, and hypokinesia. The monitor consists of a set of four inertial sensors. Validity of our monitor was established in seven healthy controls and six PD patients treated with deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus. The patients were tested at three different levels of DBS treatment. Subjects were monitored while performing different tasks, including motor tests of the Unified PD Rating Scale (UPDRS). Output of the monitor was compared to simultaneously recorded videos. The monitor proved very accurate in discriminating between several motor activities. Monitor output correlated well with blinded UPDRS ratings during different DBS levels. The combined analysis of motor activity and symptom severity by our PD monitor brings true ambulatory monitoring of a wide variety of motor symptoms one step closer.},

Support Vector Machines (SVM) have been well known method in the machine learning community for binary classification problems. Multi-class SVMs (MCSVM) are usually implemented by combining several binary SVMs. The objective of this work is to show: first, robustness of various kind of kernels for Multi-class SVM classifier, second, a comparison of different constructing methods for Multi-class SVM, such as One-Against-One and One-Against-All, and finally comparing the classifiers' accuracy of Multi-class SVM classifier to AdaBoost and Decision Tree. The simulation results show that One-Against-All Support Vector Machines (OAASVM) are superior to One-Against-One Support Vector Machines (OAOSVM) with polynomial kernels. The accuracy of OAASVM is also higher than AdaBoost and Decision Tree classifier on hypothyroid disease datasets from UCI machine learning dataset.},
